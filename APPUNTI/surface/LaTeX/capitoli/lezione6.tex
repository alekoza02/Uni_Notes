\begin{itemize}
    \item SSA: Specific Surface Area is the total surface area
    \item PSD: Pore Size and Pore Size Distribution is size of the pores and their distribution
    \item CPV: Cumulative Pore Volume is the totale volume of pores (empty space)
\end{itemize}
Trovi tutto sulle slide, ha solo letto, l'unica roba importante da ricordare Ã¨ questa qua sopra. So we have two different ways to classify the pores: Size and Shape.
Can consensation occour in micro-pores? \textbf{NO!}

To measure the adsorption, we use liquid nitrogen (inhert), so that we are sure to cover completely the surface.
