Definition of interface: boundary between two phases, but with no abrupt
change in density

why does it change gradually?think about a gas and a solid...

The words interface and surface are often used synonymously, although interface is
preferred for the boundary between two condensed phases and in cases where the
two phases are named explicitly, e.g. the solid/gas interface, but the surface of a solid.

Usually surface differs from the bulk both in chemical composition and physical properties.

POROSITY: 
![[Pasted image 20250311101336.png]]
Opened pores are interacting. High surface area materials have thousands of $m^2/g$ of specific surface area!!! It means that the contain a lot of micropores.
It is important to discriminate between external and internal surface area. The pores must be characterized in terms of pore volume, pore size and pore size distribution.

Classification of pores:
- micropores: $<2 nm$ 
- mesopores: $2-50 nm$
- macropores: $>50 nm$ 

Possible applications of porous materials: adsorption, filtration.
Applications in everyday life: electronics, cleaning, catalysis, energy ( photovoltaic, fuel cells...), biological issues (prosthetic compatibility, membrane chemistry...).

Materials like charcoal and silico-alumina--> variable pores size
Materials like zeolites and clay minerals -->entirely micro- or meso-porous,
respectively.


THE IMPORTANCE OF HIGH VACUUM IN PHYSICS
The ideal situation in early surface physics was a solid surface created by cleaving a solid body into two halves, thereby exposing two surfaces, without any interference from surrounding gas or liquid. In other words, the cleavage had to occur in a perfect, ultra-high vacuum.

Surface chemistry is the exact opposite: the presence of molecules, in either the gas or liquid phase, which could interact with the surface was a central and inherent ingredient from the beginning.
