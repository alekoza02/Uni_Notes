ADSORPTION
Adsorption is the adhesion of molecules (or ions and atoms) to the surface of a solid or liquid. 
➢ The molecules accumulated only at the surface and do not enter the bulk of the adsorbing material.
➢ The concentration of the adsorbed molecules is always greater in the immediate vicinity of the surface than in the free phase. 
➢ Exothermic process

ABSORPTION
 bulk phenomenon, physical or chemical process in which atoms, molecules or ions enter some bulk phase solid or liquid material.
  ➢ It implies that the absorbed substance is uniformly distributed throughout the body of the solid or liquid. 
  ➢ Endothermic process

From now we will consider **adsorption** phenomena. The reverse of sorption is desorption (used indifferently for adsorption and absorption).
