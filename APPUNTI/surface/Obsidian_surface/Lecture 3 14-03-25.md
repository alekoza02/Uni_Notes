==Characterisation methods in surface science==

1) Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED)
2) X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS)

How? -->  we need probes that investigate the material penetrating only a few layers (50 Å or less). The probes are thus in terms of escape depth of the detected:
- photons (not good as there penetration and escape depths are typically 10 nm or
more)
- ions present other problems
- electrons: escape depth determined by inelastic mean free path (IMFP = $\lambda$)

In the central range of energies, we have the MFP that we want

LEED belongs to the first category, XPS to the second category.

LEED --> developed by Davisson and Germer, it gives atomic geometry
AES, XPS give atomic composition, developed thanks to the UHV

==LEED==

It provides only surface info. De Broglie relation--> $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mKE}}$$
it's a diffraction technique: a beam of electrons of a well defined low energy (typically in the range 20
- 200 eV) is incident normally on the sample. The diffracted electrons can be observed by a fluorescent screen after energy-filtering grids, which selects only the electrons with the same kinetic energy as the primary electrons.

electron diffraction was discovered very early in 1900, but the development of LEED was around 1960, XRD developed very quickly because LEED is dominated by dynamic (multiple) scattering, XRD by kinematic (single)  scattering.

==XPS==
Photoelectrons are generated into the whole volume samples by the X-rays,
but can escape only from a very thin surface layer.

The binding energy depends on the atomic number: the higher is $Z$, the higher is $E_b$ (also called BE). 
The kinetic energy of the photogenerated electrons is $$E_k=h\nu -E_b$$
![[Pasted image 20250314102150.png]]
by considering just one value of Z, see that BE is lower as you go further from the nucleus.
The cross-section, which indicates the probability to detect a photoelectron from
a certain electronic level, decreases by moving towards the valence band.

Types of photoelectrons:
- Core photoelectrons, those which occupy the most internal electronic
levels, i.e. with high binding energy;
- Valence photoelectrons, those closer to the Fermi level, i.e. small BE,
< 20 eV)
- Auger photoelectrons, which are produced as a consequence of atom
deexcitation (1100 – 1200 eV)

Spectra of XPS are always in terms of binding energy, so they are not related to the specific instrument. Info from XPS spectra are:
- chemical composition (BE depends on Z)
- oxidation state of an element: removal of an electron increase the BE. It's harder to remove an electron from an oxidised state, so we can distinguish a stable metal from an oxidised metal.

 using this principle, we have different applications:

1)
![[Pasted image 20250314103734.png]]
Al2p XPS spectrum of aluminium surface. The relative intensity of the peaks due to metal Al and Al-oxide can be used to estimate the thickness of the oxide layer.
2) distinguish different functional groups:

for instance, functionalized/non functionalized CNTs:

Can be also a quantitative analysis of functional groups on the main structure 
- band structure for a solid
Spin orbit coupling give paired peaks:
