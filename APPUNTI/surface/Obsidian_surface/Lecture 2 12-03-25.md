==Thermodynamic at surfaces==
All surfaces are energetically unfavourable in that they have a positive
free energy of formation $\Delta G > 0$ : making a surface means cutting  a solid, so breaking bonds---> energetically costly.

Surface tension: 
The work made to increase the surface 𝜎 of a small amount 𝑑𝜎 can be
described as $𝑑𝑤_s = −\gamma 𝑑 \sigma = -dG$, where 𝜸 is the surface tension, measured as
energy/area ($J/m^2$ or $N/m$)
$$\Rightarrow \gamma = (\frac{\partial G_s}{\partial \sigma})_{P,T}$$
At the simplest level, we can ascribe the existence of surface tension to the
reduction in bonds for molecules at the liquid surface. Formally it is the
additional free energy per unit area required to remove molecules from the
bulk liquid to create the surface.

(RECAP OF HOW SURFACTANTS WORK)

$\Rightarrow$ the tendency in nature is decreasing the surface: e.g., droplets of water are spherical, the shape that minimise the area keeping constant the volume, where the surface tension $\gamma$ is isotropic.

**Thermodynamic at solid surfaces**

here, the shape of a sphere never occurs, but the shape is given by the growth of the crystal along the most stable direction.

Surface phenomena are driven by the minimization of the surface free energy achieved either:
1) by reducing the area of the surface by assuming a spherical shape
2) by adsorption from the gas phase;
3) by altering the local surface atomic geometry reconstructing in a way which reduces the surface free energy;
in general, the most stable surfaces are those with the highest density of atoms. Very often in  solids, it happen with ( 1 1 1 ) sufaces, while for surface (1 0 0) is slightly lower.
see picture 1: octahedron is preferred thermodinamically, while the sphere is preferred speaking about surface tension--> in nature, the shape is something in the middle

$\Rightarrow$ Wulff construction
In slide n 56, g means $\gamma$. lower $\gamma_{hkl}$ means higher probability (hkl) is expressed.
The use of surfactants during synthesis, ca stabilize certain surfaces in order to drive the growth of the nanoparticles exposing the surfaces that we want.

Relaxation and reconstruction
Relaxation: smallest movements of surface layers: spheres at the surface go closer to the lower layer (it's a movement perpendicular to the surface) so we say that the surface is relaxed
Reconstruction: larger displacements of the surface atoms
real case of reconstruction: Si

where the surface energy is lowered, and the periodicity is interrupted.

Gas adsorption:  see video at the link at pag 58
Absorption is when molecules enter inside a material.
Adsorption is when molecules are confined to the surface. 

Gas adsorption gives a decrease in entropy, while we know that this phenomenon is energetically favoured, so adsorption is an exothermic process :
$$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$$
if $\Delta G$ and $\Delta S$ are negative, the variation of entalpy must be negative, which means that gas adsorption is an exothermic process. 

We define the *Dispersion*, the ratio btw the number of atoms at the surface wrt the number of atoms in the bulk.
$$\huge D=(\frac{N_{surf}}{N_{bulk}})$$
