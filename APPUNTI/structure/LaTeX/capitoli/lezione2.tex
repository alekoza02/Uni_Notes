\section{13-03-25: | Scattering}

There's a long demonstration, you can see it in the Obsidian files, but overall it's explaining how to obtain values like energy and periodicity from crystal coordinate system.
It also explains how electrons tends to accumulate in specific regions, which are responsible of the scattering of photons, and it is what we actually are able to see.
