\section{17-03-25: | Diffraction}

From now on we will consider Diffraction $\equiv$ Diffusion operated by a periodic system. Important, to calculate the reciprocal vectors you can use:
\begin{equation}
    \vec{a^*} = \frac{\vec{b} \wedge \vec{c}}{V}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Intensity considerations:} We get the instensity from the number of counts over a time times the area. This means that that is proportional to the probability of scattering at a certain factor, giving us the structure factor $F(\vec{H})$ (which is related to the crystalline structure and Bragg's law).
Seguendo gli appunti su Obsidian, arriviamo inoltre a parlare del Debye-Waller factor ($\sim e^{-B_j\vec{H}^2}$), which takes into account the atomic vibration.
