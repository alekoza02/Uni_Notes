$$I_{theoretical}(\vec H)\approx |F(\vec H)|^2\frac{V{cry}}{V_{EC}^2}\underbrace{K(2 \theta)}_{correction factor}$$

we want to compare the theoretical and the experimental intensities.
It's required to introduce a scale factor $S$ related to the experimental set-up (that accounts for the crystal size, incident intensity, detector efficiency and more): $$|F(\vec H)|^2\frac{V{cry}}{V_{EC}^2}\underbrace{K(2 \theta)}_{correction factor} \mathcal {Scale} \leftrightarrow I_{exp}(\vec H)$$
we thus define $\huge \Omega = \sum_{\vec H}\frac{[I_{theo}(\vec H)-I_{exp}(\vec H)]^2}{\sigma^2(\vec H)}$ in order to minimise this function.

$$\huge F(\vec H)\approx \sum_{j=1}^{N_{atoms}} e^{2 \pi i \vec H \cdot \vec R_{j,0}}e^{-B_j\vec H^2} f_j(\vec H)$$
we start from the condition that we are approximating the coordinates of the atoms $\vec R_{j,0}$, then we will refine them. Same for $B_j$ and $\mathcal S$ . This procedure is called STRUCTURE REFINEMENT.

$B_j$ is known as thermal parameter or as "atomic displacement parameter". 

STRUCTURE SOLVING
electron density is lattice invariant: $$\rho(\vec x)= \rho(\vec x +\vec T)= \frac{1}{V}\sum_{\vec H}A(\vec H)e^{-2\pi i \vec H \cdot \vec x}$$
where $\vec T= m\vec a+n \vec b + p \vec c \in \mathbb N$  and where the summation over $\vec H$ means the sum of hkl from $+\infty$ to $-\infty$ and $A(\vec H)$ is a series of Fourier coefficients.
The Fourier coefficients correspond to the structure factor:  $$F(\vec H)\rightarrow A(\vec H)= \int_{V_{EC}}e^{2 \pi i \vec H \cdot \vec x}\rho(\vec x)dV$$
experimentally is possible to notice that:$$I_{observed}(\vec H)\propto |F(\vec H)|^2$$
so, just because the structure factor is a complex function, we can just know its modulus.
$F(\vec H)= |F(\vec H)|e^{i \phi (\vec H)}$ ----> that's why the problem of defining the structure factor is called "the phase problem".
There are 3 methods used for structure solving:
1) maximum entropy method (MEM) we just want to find the electron density in a grid of pixels inside the elementary cell (see picture 1) and we sink the electron density at each node (in the picture we see the $j^{th}$ pixel). We don't know nothing about $\rho_j$, but we assume that $\rho_j$ must be the best possible values that maximise the function $$\Omega = \sum_{j=1}^{pixels}\rho_j ln(\rho_j)$$ which is called "ENTROPY". So searching the $max(\Omega)$ (with the Lagrange multipliers method), we find the electron density.
When we have a set of $\{ \rho_j \}$, we are able to calculate $F_{theo}(\vec H)$. We also know that $$\sum_{j=1}\rho_j=\text{n electrons}$$
and we have the constraint that $\underbrace {\{ \rho_j \}\rightarrow F_{theo}(\vec H) \text{ where } |F_{theo}(\vec H)|= |F_{exp}(\vec H)|}$ 
2) charge flipping method: tricky but effective 
It exist a set of structure factors written as $F(\vec H)= |F_{exp}(\vec H)|e^{i \huge\phi_{guess}(\vec H)} \rightarrow \rho_j^{[0]}$ where the apex $^{[0]}$is the zero level of approximation and it's preferable to pixel the cell;
so we use the guess phase for the electron density: $\rho(\vec x)=\frac{1}{V}\sum_{\vec H}F(\vec H)e^{-2 \pi i \vec H \cdot \vec x}$
and we take $|\rho_j^{[0]}|$, meaning that we change the negative sign in positive, when it occurs(we thus flip the charge). We this obtain $\rho_j^{[1]}$. Now we calculate the structure factor associated with this electron density: $F^{[1]}(\vec H)$. For each structure factor, I can determine the phases $\phi^{[1]}(\vec H)$ . Taking these phases, I reconstruct a new structure factor, that is $|F_{exp}(\vec H)|e ^{i\phi^{[1]}(\vec H)}$ .  I repeat the procedure as an iterative process.

3) direct methods (set of methods with common basic idea): we know how to solve $$F(\vec H)= \underbrace{|F(\vec H)|}_{experimental}*\underbrace{e^{i \phi}}_{missing}$$
we will not see in detail, but there are techniques able to investigate the probability of having a given phase $\phi$. 
- $$f_j(\vec H)= \int e^{2 \pi i \vec H \cdot \vec x} \rho_{j,atom}(\vec x)dV \approx \int e^{2 \pi i \vec H \cdot \vec x} \rho(|\vec x|)dV= f_j(|\vec H|)$$
by the way, using the Bragg's law, we have that $|\vec H|= \frac{2}{\lambda}sin \theta$ . We find in the literature a dependance $f_j(\frac{sin \theta}{\lambda})$ instead of $f_j(|\vec H|)$. 
- $\rho_{j,atoms}(\vec x)$ can be modelled (with LDA, DFT, HF $\dots$ ) and minimized with the refinement but the position $j^{th}$ has to be known
Parametrisation of $f_j(|\vec H|)$: $$f_j(\frac{sin \theta}{\lambda})= c_0+ \sum_{k=1}^{4,6}a_k \huge e^{-(\frac{sin \theta}{\lambda})^2b_k}$$
where the summation goes to 4,5,6 because it's enough to have a good estimation. In order to have a good precision, we can stop to 6.

ANOMALOUS SCATTERING
Larmor law: $\mathcal P \propto q^2 \vec a^2$ 
The acceleration, $\huge \vec a= \ddot{\vec x} = \frac{\vec E q}{m}$ can be expressed introducing a term of velocity, $$\ddot{ \vec x}+ \underbrace{\gamma \dot{\vec x}}_{\text{damping factor}}=\frac{\vec E q}{m}$$
by introducing the damping factor, we cannot describe $f(\vec H)$ as we said before, but we have to introduce a couple of terms more: $$f(\vec H)= \underbrace{\int e^{2 \pi i \vec H \cdot \vec x} \rho_{atom}(\vec x)dV}_{\huge f_0(\vec H)}+ \underbrace{f'(\lambda)+if''(\lambda)}_{\text{anomalous contribution}}$$
the anomalous contribution is relevant only in resonant conditions.
(see picture 2)
where $\lambda_0$ is the resonance wavelength, at which $f'$ becomes extremely important. $\lambda_0$ depends on the chemical species.
By looking at $f''$, we see a step at the resonance wavelength (or resonance energy):

HOW TO TREAT THE CASE OF SOLID SOLUTION
$$F(\vec H)= \sum_{j=1}^{atoms}e^{2 \pi i \vec H \cdot \vec x_{j,0}}* e^{B_j\vec H^2}\underbrace{[f_{0j}(\frac{sin \theta}{\lambda})+ f'_j (\lambda)+ if''_j(\lambda)]}_{\text{anomalous scattering } f_j(\frac{sin \theta}{\lambda},\lambda)}$$
and we assume that there are no vacancies, so the sum of each probability of occupancy in each site $j$ is 1: $P_j^{Mg}+ P_j^{Fe}=1$ for instance. The contribution of occupancy of each site is represented generally by $$\huge e^{2 \pi i \vec H \cdot \vec x_{j0}}e^{-B_j\vec H^2}[P_j^{Mg}f_{Mg}(\frac{sin \theta}{\lambda}, \lambda)+ P_j ^{Fe}f_{Fe}(\frac{sin \theta}{\lambda}, \lambda)]$$
