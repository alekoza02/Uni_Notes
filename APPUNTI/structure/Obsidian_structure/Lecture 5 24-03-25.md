EXPERIMENTAL SETUPS FOR DIFFRACTION
- collection geometries
- recording architectures
- radiation sources  (conventional & large scale facilities, so neutrons or synchrotrone)
Talking about photons:
Photon flux= $\huge\frac{dN}{dt}$  
Photon irradiance= $\frac{dN}{dt}A$ 

(see other parameters concerning this topic in slides)

Inverse geometry: 
WHITE BEAM SOURCE --> SAMPLE --> MONOCHROMATOR --> DETECTOR

Direct geometry:
Used in our virtual experiments in order to explain the phenomena

WHITE BEAM SOURCE --> MONOCHROMATOR --> SAMPLE --> DETECTOR

MONOCHRMATORS
1) electronic discrimination: selection of a given $\lambda$ using electronics. It is integrated to the detector. cheaper than the crystal discriminator
2) crystal discriminator: oriented in the space so that, exploiting the Bragg's law, we can select a given $\lambda$ (constructing interference between waves) with a certain tolerance ($\lambda + \Delta \lambda$). However, if we were able to select a precise wavelength, the intensity would be too low!

**Single crystal diffraction**
2 main geometries wrt the nature of the detector:
- old approach: point detectors
- new: position sensitive detectors --> faster
(cool picture in slide about what happens mathematically in a diffraction experiment)

POWDER DIFFRACTION
Different signals are folding together: many single crystals with all the possible orientations.
- transmission geometry: (Debye-Sherrer) we have a glass capillary. Glass is amorphous, so it does not return Bragg's peaks.

on each cone surface lie the diffracted beams characterised by the same $|\vec H|$, i.e. such as to fulfil the Bragg law at the same $2\theta$ angle.

$$\frac{2}{|\vec H|}sin (\theta_{hkl})= \lambda$$

Focus mainly on the second set-up:

- Bragg-Brentano geometry:

How it works:
two circles that determine where detector, sample and x-ray tube must lie on.

It's possible to convert a Debye-Sherrer geometry to Bragg-Brentano:

**Resolution:** ability of the diffractometer to separate two close peaks
![[Pasted image 20250324154848.png]]
from the picture we see that putting the detector further, we have a higher separation of the peaks, but having lower irradiance, so lower intensity.

**Counting uncertainty**
![[Pasted image 20250324155129.png|center|200]]
where N is the number of photons been recorded. The ratio btw uncertainty and counts, then we have that is $\approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$, so if we wat to improve the precision of the measurement, we have to accumulate as many counts as possible, spending a lot of time.

MODEL A POWDER DIFFRACTION PROFILE: RIETVELD METHOD
(see picture 1)
- background (BKG)--> any sort of spurious contribution to the signal, artefact of the experiment. Generally, it's flat, but in some cases is not. Using condition devices (using certain values of Pressure or/and Temperature) we have different shapes of the background:
(see picture 2)
So in general we see that the $BKG= BKG(2\theta)$ 
---> how can we model the profile? $$BKG(2\theta)+ \dots$$
We take into account the height of the diffraction peak: $$BKG(2\theta)+ |F_{hkl}|^2 \dots$$
Introducing the concept of multiplicity $M_{hkl}$, which is the number of $\vec H$ vectors sharing the same length : $$BKG(2\theta)+ |F_{hkl}|^2 *M_{hkl} \dots$$
however this in an approximation: the structure factor is *more or less* the same for different $\vec H$ sharing the same length.

Now, introducing the profile function $P(2 \theta)$: $$BKG(2\theta)+ |F_{hkl}|^2 *M_{hkl} * P(2 \theta)$$
where, e.g. it's $$P(2\theta)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}\sigma}\huge{e^{-(\frac{2 \theta- 2 \theta_0}{\sigma})^2}}$$ which is the Gaussian function, very popular at the beginning of the creation of the Rietveld method.
$\theta_0$ is the maximum of the peak, determined by $hkl$ and $\vec a, \vec b, \vec c$ . 
(see picture 3)---> peak broadening described by $\sigma$, strictly related to the *reactivity* of the sample. 
$$BKG(2\theta)+ |F_{hkl}|^2 *M_{hkl} * P(2 \theta)*K(2 \theta) * S$$
where $S$ is the scale factor, which gives the efficiency of the detector, in other words the power of the source.

--> $$\text{Diffraction pattern} \Rightarrow BKG(2\theta)+ \sum_{hkl}\left[S* |F_{hkl}|^2 *M_{hkl} * P(2 \theta)*K(2 \theta)  \right]$$The Rietveld method is a search of  the best fit for the experimental pattern. This is given by:
- position of the atoms
- atomic displacement
- cell vectors
- $\dots$
