Theoretical profile function($2\theta$)= $BKG(2 \theta)+ \sum_{hlk} \left[ \mathcal S*|F_{hkl}|^2*M_{hkl}*K(2 \theta)* P(2 \theta, 2 \theta_{hkl}, \sigma) \right]$
where $K(2\theta)$ takes into account all the types of corrections: angular, preferred orientation, absorption$\dots$ and $\mathcal S$ is the scale factor.
$$\sum _{j=1}^{N-points} =\frac{[\text{theo PROFILE}(2 \theta_j)- [\text{exp PROFILE}(2 \theta_j)]^2 }{\sigma_j^{\text{uncertainty on meas}}}= \Omega$$

where $\Omega$ has to be minimized.

Why peak broadening? 2 effects:
- strain --> deviations from ideal structures
- diffraction domain size --> $\vec Q = \vec H + \vec \delta$  just keep in mind that broadening in case of single crystal, it's $\large \vec \delta \approx \frac{1}{N_{cell}}$   

There  exist a direct connection between these 3 latter things: let's prove it
- strain is defined as $\huge \epsilon_{strain} = \frac{\Delta d}{d}$ where $d= \huge \frac{1}{|\vec H|}$ is the average distance btw planes that contribute to diffraction and $\Delta d$ is its deviation. 
Therefore, $$\huge \epsilon_{strain} = \frac{\Delta d}{d}= \frac{\cancel\lambda cos \theta}{\cancel2( sin \theta)^\cancel2}* \frac{1}{\cancel{\frac{\lambda}{2sin \theta}}}* \Delta \theta= \frac{cos \theta}{sin \theta} \Delta \theta$$
where $\large d= \frac{\lambda}{2 sin \theta}$ so $$ \large\Delta \theta = \epsilon_{strain} \frac{sin \theta}{cos \theta}$$
- domain size: (see picture 1)
![[06_1.jpg|center|400]]
we see many domains misoriented one wrt the other.The resulting object still simulate an ideal crystal. How can we represent the magnitude of this effect? $$ \large \epsilon_{\text{domain size}} = \Delta |\vec H|= \frac{2}{\lambda} cos \theta \Delta \theta$$
$\Rightarrow$  $$\huge \Delta \theta = \frac{\lambda \epsilon_{\text{domain size}}}{2cos \theta}$$
The final PD pattern is the sum of all the contributions of the different phases each multiplied by their fraction in mass. Therefore, the theoretical profile is given by $w_1 * Theo.prof_1 + w_2* Theo.prof_2 + \dots + w_n*Theo.prof_n$ made as well as possible in order to fit the observed profile. Adjusting the wights, we find the PHASE COMPOSITION of the mixture of crystallites composing the whole real crystal.

POWDER DIFFRACTION CONCLUSIONS:
- useful for the determination of $\vec a, \vec b, \vec c$ by analysing the peaks positions (traditional rough way)
- let us be able to refine the structure
- allow us to estimate reactivity by analysing the broadening $\sigma$ 
- determine phase recognition because each phase has a particular elementary cell in terms of lattice parameters
- phase composition determination (quantitatively)

SINGLE CRYSTAL DIFFRACTION CONCLUSIONS:
- focus on structure solving (when we don't know anything about how atoms are placed)
- structure refinement (when you know more or less the structure, but you want to optimise your data, or when you want to see how the system changes varying thermodynamic quantities) however it's preferable using powder diffraction for refinement, when you are interested in an overview of the material seen as a whole. 
- can not determine reactivity
- phase recognition, composition ---> here we have just one phase

Overall, these 2 techniques are complementary.

MUST KNOW FOR THE EXAM:
- Scattering processes
- Larmor law (why, relation to elastic diffusion)
- Scattering in crystals: metric ($\vec H \vec \delta$) and chemical-physical contributions ($F_{hkl}$) --> Debye-Wallor factor and meaning of reciprocal space
- $F_{hkl}$ in practical form (must write) $\sum_{j=1}^N e^{2 \pi \vec x_{j0} \cdot \vec H} e^{- \vec H^2 B_j}f_j$
