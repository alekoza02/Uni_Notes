CRISTALLOGRAPHY

A crystal is a solid where atoms are placed according to a well defined order. 
Elementary cell: element by which we can construct the whole crystal lattice by translation of it
(picture 1).
![[01_1.jpg]]

It's defined by vectors that determine uniquely the elementary cell. In 3D: $\vec a, \vec b, \vec c$ called lattice vectors. Using the right hand:
$\vec a$ indice
$\vec b$ medio
$\vec c$ pollice
Lattice translation vectors: the set of the lattice translation vectors that is composed by $$\vec T = n\vec a+m\vec b+ p \vec c$$ where $n,m,p$ are integers numbers. Their origin is each node of the lattice. They characterise the crystal and its properties.
Lattice translation invariance: if we have  a generic property (electric field, magnetic field...) $\phi$ :
$$\phi(\vec x)= \phi(\vec x + \vec T)$$
We can expand this function using Fourier transform, but we will not dive into this topic in detail.
Crystal site: a position in the crystal that can be filled by an atom. It's seen as a potential well, so a crystal is an object composed as a cluster of sites, that are potential wells.  (see picture 2).

Let's clarify that perfect crystals nearly do not exist, so we have in reality a quite different arrangement of atoms in the lattice. If the lattice have holes, these holes are potential wells that can be filled with different species, having so a solid state mixing. The elementary cell notion holds, but the crystal site is not occupied by a specific atom or another, but the PROBABILITY of being occupied by that atom: CRYSTAL SITE OCCUPANCY. For instance, we have a crystal where each elementary cell is given by two sites, one is O and is Fe or Mg. If we have 12 cells, and 4 sites are occupied by Fe and 8 by Mg, the occupancy probability is $4/12$ and $8/12$ respectively for Fe and Mg. 

SCATTERING PROCESSES
We have a source of radiations like photons, neutrons or electrons. This beam is oriented toward the crystal, which acts as scatterer. A detector investigates how the radiation is diffused, so we can reconstruct how atoms are placed. We call $E_i$ the incident beam energy. If the final energy of the scattered beam $E_f \not= E_i$ , we have an inelastic scattering.  If $E_f = E_i$ , we have elastic scattering, by far more intense than inelastic one. 
Scattering experiments: 
we use the momentum(not unique definition)
- $\vec k_i= \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \vec \tau_i$ or $\vec k_i= \frac{\vec \tau_i}{\lambda_i}$ where $\vec \tau$ is the direction of incident radiation, it a unitary vector.
- $\vec k_f= \frac{\vec \tau_f}{\lambda_f}$ where $\vec \tau_f$ is the direction of the scattered radiation
- momentum transfer $\vec Q= \vec k_f - \vec k_i$
However, from $\lambda$ we drop the subscript $i,f$ because we treat elastic scattering, thus: $$\vec Q= \vec k_f - \vec k_i = \frac{1}{\lambda} (\vec \tau_f -\vec \tau_i)$$
Let's now consider that we have to do with photons. Their energy is $E= cp$ where $p \lambda = h$ that is the De Broglie relation, so $$E= \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
The beam of incident photons have momentum $\vec k_i$. What is the probability $P_{\huge \vec k_i \rightarrow \vec k_f}$ to have scattering process of elastic type and such that they produce a $\vec k_f$? By using  a detector that records $\vec Q$ and the intensity associated. 

$P_{\vec k_i \rightarrow \vec k_f} \approx |\int \psi_i(\vec x) ^* I(\vec x) \psi_f(\vec x) dV|^2 =|\langle i | I | f \rangle|^2$ Where $I(\vec x)$ is the interaction.

How to describe the interaction, the function that describe how the crystal deviates the radiation? We use the Larmor expression.

**Larmor expression**
(see picture 3)
![[01_3.jpg]]
We have an incident electric field that strikes a charged particle and makes it oscillate, according to harmonic motions. We assume that this particle is an electron. Using Maxwell equations, Larmor demonstrated that this charge generates elm waves. The power irradiated is $\propto$ to the squared charge multiplied by the squared acceleration: $P \propto q^2 \vec a^2$ .
Let's recall the electron density : |$\psi(\vec x)$|$^2$ = $\rho(\vec x)$ such that $\rho(\vec x) dV = \delta n_e$ number of electrons in the infinitesimal volume dV at $\vec x$.  
Notice that $\rho(\vec x)= \rho(\vec x+ \vec T)$ .
$$\delta P \propto \delta q^2 \vec a^2$$
where the acceleration is $\vec a= \huge \frac{\vec F}{m}= \frac{\vec E \delta q}{\delta m}$ 

where $\huge \frac{\delta q}{\delta m} = \frac{e \delta n}{m_e\delta n}= \frac{e}{m_e}$ so the infinitesimal power expression becomes $$\delta P \propto \frac{\vec Ee}{m_e}e^2 \rho(\vec x)^2dV dV$$
So $\delta P \propto \rho(\vec x)^2 dV dV$ ----> $\huge P_{\vec k_i \rightarrow \vec k_f} \propto |\psi_i^* (\vec x) \rho(\vec x) \psi _f(\vec x) dV|^2$ 

(see picture 4)

How to describe $\psi_i(\vec x)$ and $\psi_f (\vec x)$ ?
Using a plane wave $\psi_i(\vec x) = exp[2 \pi i \vec k_i \cdot \vec x -i\omega t]$ --> $\psi_f(\vec x) = exp[2 \pi \vec k_f \cdot \vec x -i\omega t]$ 


$$|\int exp[-2 \pi i \vec k_i \cdot \vec x + \cancel{i \omega t}] \rho(\vec x) exp[2 \pi i\vec k_f \cdot \vec x \cancel{-i\omega t}] dV|^2 =$$
$$= | \int\rho(\vec x) exp[2 \pi i(\vec k_f - \vec k_i)\cdot \vec x ] dV|^2= $$
$$ =  | \int \rho(\vec x) exp[2 \pi  \vec Q\cdot \vec x] dV|^2$$Thus $\huge P_{\vec k_i \rightarrow \vec k_f} \propto |\rho(\vec x) e^{2 \pi \vec Q \cdot \vec x} dV|^2$ 

Using the concept of nodes, we can collapse the elementary cell into its origin (see picture 5) using the set $\vec T=n\vec a+m\vec b+ p \vec c$.
![[01_5.jpg]]


$\int \rho(\vec x) exp[2 \pi i \vec Q\cdot \vec x] dV$= ? $\rightarrow$ 
$$ \int_{crystal} \rho(\vec x) exp[2 \pi i \vec Q\cdot \vec x] dV= \sum_{n,m,p} \int_{Ec_{nmp}} \rho(\vec x) exp[2 \pi i \vec Q\cdot \vec x] dV$$
where $E_c$ means elementary cell.

By defining the position $\vec x$:
$\vec x = n\vec a+m\vec b+ p \vec c + \vec y$ , $\vec y$ remains contained into the elementary cell, so 
$$\sum_{n,m,p} \int_{Ec_{nmp}} \rho(\vec x) exp[2 \pi i \vec Q\cdot \vec x] dV = \sum_{n,m,p} \int_{Ec_{000}} \rho (n \vec a+m\vec b+ p \vec c + \vec y) exp[2 \pi i \vec Q\cdot (n\vec a+m\vec b+ p \vec c + \vec y)] dV_y$$

where $\rho (n \vec a+m\vec b+ p \vec c) = \rho(\vec y)$ , now we split this last expression: $$\sum_{n,m,p} \int_{Ec_{000}} \rho (\vec y) exp[2 \pi i \vec Q\cdot \vec y] exp[2 \pi i(n\vec a+m\vec b+ p \vec c)] dV_y=$$
$$= \sum_{n,m,p} e^{2 \pi i(n\vec a+m\vec b+ p \vec c)\cdot \vec Q} \int_{Ec_{000}} \rho (\vec y) e^{2 \pi i \vec Q\cdot \vec y}  dV_y$$
Using the Fourier transform we can pass from (... doubts that will be fulfilled)

$|\vec k_f|=|\vec k_i|= \frac{1}{\lambda}$ (see picture n 6)--> we define the scattering angle $2\theta$ 

![[01_6.jpg]]


From the picture we see that the violet line cuts into two halves the length of $\vec Q$, so $$\frac{|\vec Q|}{2}= \frac{1}{\lambda} sin \theta$$
in other words, $|\vec Q|= \frac{2}{\lambda} sin \theta$ --> BRAGG'S LAW that says that a limit exists during a scattering experiment: there is a max length of the Q vector: $$|\vec Q| \leq \frac{2}{\lambda}$$
Until now we have supposed that the incident beam is characterized by just one wavelength (monochromatic condition). All our discussions will be in the frame of this setup, but it is not the only possible experimental configuration.
