PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS IN SOLIDS
see chapter 5 book [[phase-transformations-in-metals-and-alloys.pdf]]
Most phase transformations require diffusion of atoms.

Classification of phase transformations from a thermodynamic POV:
- 1st order: discontinuity in the first derivative of free energy:

- 2nd order:  discontinuity in second derivative of free energy (e.g. magnetic transition)

Classification of phase transformations from a mechanism POV:
- Diffusional Transformations: These involve the long-range movement of atoms and are typically slower. Most phase transformation in metallurgy are diffusional. They can be further distinguished in:
	-  heterogeneous: occur via nucleation and growth of one or more new phases. 
	-  homogeneous: occur only via diffusion, no nucleation nor growth. Example: spinodal decomposition
- Displacive Transformations:  These involve a change in the material's structure through the shift of atoms over relatively short distances and can be much faster. Example: martensitic transformations in steel (Fe-C alloys)
Types of mechanisms:
-  precipitation $\alpha_{(\text{single phase})}\rightarrow \alpha + \beta$

(i) eutettic phase diagram; (ii) peritectic phase diagram; (iii) eutectoid phase diagram where we have precipitation

- eutectoid $\gamma \rightarrow \alpha + \beta$ 
The eutectoid reaction is reversible, meaning the two solid products can transform back into the original solid phase upon reheating to the eutectoid temperature.

- ordering reaction $\alpha \rightarrow \alpha'$ 
![[Pasted image 20250318093017.png]]
Refers to the process by which atoms in a solid solution rearrange themselves into a more ordered structure without changing the overall composition of the alloy. This transformation results in a decrease in the material's entropy but an increase in its internal order, leading to the formation of a new phase with a distinct crystal structure. 

- massive $\beta \rightarrow \alpha$ 
![[Pasted image 20250318093916.png]]
(i) diffusion of $\beta$ in $\alpha$ if the cool down is slow; massive transformation is when the cool down is fast (to check...)

- Polymorphic (or polymorphous)   $\gamma \rightarrow \alpha$
![[Pasted image 20250318093939.png]]
a material changes its crystal structure without changing its chemical composition (pure elements or compounds). This transformation occurs in materials that can exist in more than one crystallographic form, known as polymorphs, depending on temperature, pressure, or other external conditions
