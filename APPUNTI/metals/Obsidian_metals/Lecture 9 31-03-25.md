BAINITE
Bainite contains ferrite and cementite. Microstructure is different from pearlite because of varied nucleation and growth mechanism: TTT curves for bainite and pearlite overlap in C-steels.

First ferrite $\alpha$ nucleates forming a specific orientation, then ejecting C atoms, cementite $Fe_3C$ grows. All the interfaces are incoherent, semicoherent.
Contrary to pearlite, bainitic phases have orientation relationship with $\gamma_2$ : semicoherent interface which has been described as ***glissile***. 
Two types of bainite:
- upper (feathery) : ferrite nucleates with K-S orientation on $\gamma_1$, (~550 - 400 °C)
- lower (acicular): ferrite plates nucleate and grow with supersaturation. Some carbide needles nucleate at $\gamma - \alpha$ interface, others precipitate from supersaturated ferrite. (~ 400 - 250 °C)

Civilian and military transformations:
Civilian transformation is the type seen until now. The diffusion of atoms doesn't happen in a specific direction for each flux of atoms, only on average the diffusion is specific.
Military transformation: like martensitic transformation; motion of atoms is very well ordered, not with a long range of jumps of atoms. 

Bainitic transformations are sort of mixed between civilian and military.

ADDITION OF ALLOYING ELEMENTS:
![[Pasted_image_20250331092725.png]]
Like transition metals, Cr, The main effect comes from the fact that the rate of diffusion is faster for the introduction of *interstitial* elements wrt substitutional elements.

(see pag 342 book):
"The primary aim of adding alloying elements to steels is to increase the hardenability, that is, to delay the time required for the decomposition into ferrite and pearlite. This allows slower cooling rates to produce fully martensitic structures"

Notice the huge difference adding just 0.9% Cr:

CONTINUOUS COOLING CURVES (CTT)
TTT are "limiting" from an industrial point of view: we see in the TTT transformations at ideal constant Temperature. It's not so feasible, industrially we use continuous cooling.

- yellow: experimental data
- green: CTT diagram obtained from experimental data---> shift to longer times and lower temperatures.
- A,B,C,D(dashed): cooling curves
- D curve: slowest cooling; A curve: fastest cooling
- cooling curves cross the regions where we have a specific phase
- notice that following B curve, not all the austenite is transformed into pearlite!
- At T<400°C, potentially we can transform austenite to martensite, however for C and D curve there is no austenite left, while for A and B martnesite can be formed. We see at the bottom of the diagram the final structures that confirm that.

How do we experimentally obtain CTT curves? We start from a bar fixed at one edge and heated up. first, the T is homogeneus, the we send cooling water on the other edge, so that part cools down very quickly. The T is measured on function of the length of the bar, where we observe for each the shape at microscope.

SPINODAL DECOMPOSITION: (pag. 302)
![[Pasted_image_20250331102915.webp|500]]

- SPINODAL REGION: There are certain transformations where there is no barrier to nucleation. One of these is the spinodal mode of transformation. Consider a phase diagram with a miscibility gap as shown in Fig. 5.38a. If an alloy with composition X0 is solution treated at a high temperature T1 and then quenched to a lower temperature T2 the composition will initially be the same everywhere and its free energy will be G0 on the G curve in Fig. 5.38b. However, the alloy will be immediately unstable because small fluctuations in composition that produce A-rich and B-rich regions will cause the total free energy to decrease. Therefore ‘up-hill’ diffusion takes place as shown in Fig. 5.39 until the equilibrium compositions X1 and X2 are reached.

"snapshots" of the concentration profiles: increasing time, the fluctuation is increased. We see B atoms are going toward the maxima in the plots. These processes are spontaneous, so we see the plots becoming steeper with increasing time. We end up with two separate phases corresponding to $X_1$ and $X_2$ .
- OUTSIDE THE SPINODAL REGION: we are in $X_0'$ (black dot between red dots): here the free energy is increasing, no spontaneous reaction.

MASSIVE TRANSFORMATIONS: (pag 352)
Consider the Cu–Zn alloys in Fig. 5.83 containing approximately 38 atomic % Zn. The most stable state for such alloys is β above ~800°C, a below ~500°C and a mixture of α/β with compositions given by the equilibrium phase diagram in between. The type of transformation that occurs on cooling the γ phase depends on the cooling rate. At slow to moderate cooling rates α precipitates in a similar way to the precipitation of ferrite from austenite in Fe–C alloys: slow cooling favours transformation at small undercooling and the formation of equiaxed α; higher cooling rates result in transformation at lower temperatures and Widmanstatten α needles precipitate. According to the phase diagram, the α that precipitates will be richer in Cu than the parent β phase, and therefore the growth of the α phase requires the long-range diffusion of Zn away from the advancing α/β interfaces. This process is relatively slow, especially since the Cu and Zn form substitutional solid solutions, and consequently the C curve for the α precipitation on a TTT or CCT diagram will be located at relatively long times.
![[Pasted_image_20250331104622.webp|500]]

A possible CCT diagram is shown schematically in Fig. 5.84. If the alloy is cooled fast enough, by quenching in brine for example, there is no time for the precipitation of α, and the β phase can be retained to temperatures below 500°C where it is possible for β to transform into α with the same composition. The result of such a transformation is a new massive trans‑ formation product, Fig. 5.85. Massive α grains nucleate at grain boundaries and grow rapidly into the surrounding β. Note also that because of the rapid growth the α/β boundaries have a characteristic irregular appearance. Since both the α and β phases have the same composition, massive α(αm) can grow as fast as the Cu and Zn atoms can cross the α/β interface, without the need for long-range diffusion.

The condition that must be satisfied for a massive transformation is that the free energy of the new phase must be lower than the parent phase, both phases having the same composition.
 In the case of Cu–38 atomic % Zn therefore, it can be seen from Fig. 5.86 that there is a temperature ~700°C below which Gα becomes less than Gβ. This temperature is marked as T0 in Fig. 5.83 and the locus of T0 is also shown for other alloy compositions. Therefore it may be possible for a massive transformation to occur within the two-phase region of the phase diagram anywhere below the T0 temperature. In practice, however, there is evidence that massive transformations usually occur only within the singlephase region of the phase diagram.

pptn stays for precipitation. 
Massive transformation only possible below T0 temperature, as explained in free energy scheme, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have the same free energy.
