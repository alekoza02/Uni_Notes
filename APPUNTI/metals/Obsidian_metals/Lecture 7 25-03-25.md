yellow: coherent direction

$\beta$ phase makes migrate B atoms towards itself, growing the grain in the $u$ direction
From the picture we see:
$$uh = v \lambda$$
The lateral growth rate is:

ledge = sporgenza

In order to have growth, there must be supply of ledges (e. g. by re-nucleation at
surface or edge. Spiral growth keeps ledge number constant).

**Theory of transformed fraction** (pag 27 slides)
Composition and pressure, temperature fixed. 
The "transformed fraction" f(t,T) during a phase transformation refers to the proportion of the material that has successfully transformed from the initial phase to the new phase at any given point in time during the process. This fraction can range from 0 (no transformation has occurred) to 1 (the transformation is complete, and the entire material has changed to the new phase).
