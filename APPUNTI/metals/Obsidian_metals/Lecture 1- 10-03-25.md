THERMODYNAMICS
Approach to deal with phase transformations in different metallic systems. Quick recap: study of how different forms of energy can transform into other forms. 
Terminology: 
- system: the space that we investigate
- phases: portion of a system with homogeneous properties and composition 
- component: each phase is made up of different components:  elements, chemical compounds
- Thermodynamics use variables: Temperature, Pressure, Composition($n_i$= number of moles of component $i$, $X_i$= molar fraction, ...)
- $G=H-TS$ : free Gibbs energy is the enthalpy minus the T multiplied by entropy
- Helmholtz free energy($F= U-TS$) is also used, but here we will typically use G

Notice that in metallurgy, phase transformations happen in condensed states (liquids, sometimes solids) where variations of pressure are small, so we will assume that $P\approx 1 bar$ constant over all the transformations. 

Thermodynamic quantities are extensive quantities, so we need to normalize by the number of moles in the system: 
![[Pasted image 20250310114950.png]]

We will mostly consider $X_i$ .

GIBBS FREE ENERGY
It tells when the system is at equilibrium. For an open system: $$dG = -SdT + VdP + \sum_i \mu_i dn_i + ...$$
where $\mu_i$ is the chemical potential.
A system evolves minimising G: $$dG= 0$$
$$d^2 G \geq 0$$
![[Pasted image 20250310115429.png]]
Where local minima are metastable states. Notice that point A is the real absolute minimum (stable state) while point B is a local minimum.

In thermodynamics, most often we can calculate differences in quantities: e.i. the $\Delta E$ between state A and B, or with respect to a reference state.

REFERENCE STATES
Reference states are used as baseline conditions from which changes in thermodynamic functions, such as
enthalpy (H), internal energy (U), and Gibbs free energy (G), are measured or determined from thermodynamic
equations.
A typical choice is the Standard Element Reference state (SER) in which $H_{298} = 0$and $S = S_{298}$ for the phase stable at 298 K and 1 bar for the stable phase. $S_{298}$ is the absolute entropy at 298 K calculated from$S=0$ at 0 K. For example, for pure Fe, SER is the bcc phase with $H=0$ and $S=S_{298}$ (bcc). 
Other choices are possible and equally correct (and sometimes more convenient).

SINGLE COMPONENTS SYSTEMS
(basically pure metals); P= 1 bar fixed, for each phase (bcc, fcc, liquid...) $G= H-TS$ but it is not useful, we need an integral form: $$H= H_{ref}+ \int_{ref}^{T}C_pdT$$
$$S= S_{ref}+ \int_{ref}^{T}C_pdlnT$$
where $C_p=(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T})_P$ , $\frac{C_p}{T}=(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T})_P$. $C_P$ is measurable in lab through a fitting:$$C_P = c_1 + c_2 T + c_3 T^2 + \frac{c_4}{T^2}+...+ C_{p,mag}+...$$

The huge peak of bcc curve is due to a second order transition: at low T, bcc Iron is ferromagnetic, increasing heat, it becomes paramagnetic. Other phases are non-magnetic.
From the graph G vs T we see that bcc is the most stable phase, because it has the minimum free energy. We can see some crossing points, not so visible, so we change the reference state: we use bcc at any T as baseline:
![[Pasted image 20250310121617.png]]
Where we can notice that fcc crosses the bcc curve around 1000 K so we have a transition from bcc to fcc Iron. this phase keeps stable in a certain range, then again fcc G goes up, so bcc becomes the stable phase again. At $\approx$ 1880 K the liquid phase becomes the most stable phase, so we have the fusion of the metal. If we draw back the phase diagram: ![[Pasted image 20250310121943.png]]
by using different G vs T curves. In order to understand a p-T diagram we use the rule: $v=c-f+2$

Some phase transformation occur when we are not at equilibrium conditions: example 
liquid metal undercooled by ΔT below $T_m$ before it solidify (P=1 bar).
![[Pasted image 20250310122259.png]]
Where $T_m$ is the melting point. If we cool down slowly the system, the solidification happens at $T_m$. If we cool down quickly, (undercooling), the solidification can occur at 100-200 degrees below the melting point $T_m$! 
Driving force for solidification: $\Delta G$ in the graph, it can be quantified. $G_S$ is related to the solid, $G_L$ to the liquid. We also use the quantities: 
![[Pasted image 20250310122704.png]]
we also know that at the melting point, the $\Delta G=0$:
![[Pasted image 20250310122736.png]]
where we recalled $\Delta H$ as $L$, the latent heat of fusion, while $\Delta S$ is the entropy of fusion.

If T (in the graph) is not too far from $T_m$ we can say that $$\Delta G \approx L-T \frac{L}{T_m}\approx \frac{L\Delta T}{T_m}$$
which is $\approx$ the driving force for solidification, for small $\Delta T$.

BINAR SYSTEMS, MULTICOMPONENTS SYSTEMS
In many cases, metallic materials are used as alloys. Why? To improve physical properties. 
Two components A and B metallic systems can be:
- substitutional solid solution (homogeneous systems):  the two components A and B have the same crystal structure 
- substitutional solid solution (heterogeneous systems): the two components A and B have different crystal structure 
- Interstitial solid solutions
here, A and B are more or less of the same size. Otherwise: 
- interstitial solid solutions
- There are situations where the resulting phase is not as A neither as B

**Substitutional solid solutions: 2 components, one phase**
What is the free energy after the mixing process? Here, T and P are constant.
![[Pasted image 20250310123937.png]]
The system in total is one mole (for simplicity). We take $X_A$ mol of A and $X_B$ mol of B. $G_A$ and $G_B$ are molar free energies of pure elements A and B. The total free energy of not yet mixed metals is the sum of these two, multiplied by their molar fractions.
![[Pasted image 20250310124336.png]]
Changing the molar fraction, $G_1$ essentially moves along the straight line pictured above.
$G_1$ is the Gibbs energy of the unreacted mixture.

After mixing:
![[Pasted image 20250310124505.png]]
The free energy now is changed: $G_2 = G_1 + \Delta G_{mix}$ where the last term is the mixing free energy. How to quantify it?
![[Pasted image 20250310124802.png]]

**Ideal solutions**
The simplest possible type of solution is an ideal solution, i.e. one with zero mixing enthalpy and only configurational mixing entropy. The latter can be easily evaluated from statistical thermodynamics, i.e. Boltzmann equation for entropy: $$S = k_B ln(\omega_{conf})$$
where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\omega_{conf}$ is the number of distinguishable configurations in the system. So from this, we can say that the entropy before mixing is null because $\omega_{conf}=1$. The consequence is that it's simple to conclude that $\Delta S_{mix}$ it's the entropy after mixing.
After mixing, assuming that all configurations of A and B atoms are equally probable, the number of distinguishable ways of arranging the atoms on the atomic sites is
$$\omega_{conf}=\frac{(N_A+N_B)!}{N_A!N_B!}$$
where $N_A=X_AN_a$ and $N_B=X_BN_a$ where $N_a$ is the Avogadro number . 

Let's also take into account the Sterling’s approximation (for large N): $ln(N!) \approx Nln(N) - N$ 
So the entropy of mixing is ![[Pasted image 20250310125540.png]]
where $R$ is the gas constant.
Try by yourself the computation =...=. (it's asked at the exam!!!)
