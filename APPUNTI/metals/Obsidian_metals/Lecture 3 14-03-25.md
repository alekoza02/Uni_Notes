	see picture 1 for the calculation of $G_{liq}^A$ and $G_{liq}^B$

where we assumed that $\Delta H^A_{liq-sol}\approx \Delta H^A_{m}$

see example in the excel file called "Free energy curves example"
we thus obtain:

At low T (600 K), we have a miscibility gap in the solid phase. In equilibrium, two solid solutions with different compositions (X1 and X2) are stable (common tangent construction). X1 and X2 are the molar fractions at tangent points.

this is a special T where we have 3 phases in equilibrium: the 2 solid phases and the liquid phase at $X_{eu}$: the eutectic point.

Gibbs phase rule is in the case of invariant Pressure, that's why we see "-1" instead of "-2".

Increasing further the T:

So we have:
see picture 2

Increasing again T:

Increasing one more time:

Putting all of these together, we have the phase diagram:

left diagram: at low T we have a miscibility gap.
