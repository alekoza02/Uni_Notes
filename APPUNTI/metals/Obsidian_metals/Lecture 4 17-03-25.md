SURFACES AND INTERFACES

Interfaces:
- free surface: interfaces btw solid and gas phase, or liq and gas phase. 
- grain boundaries: $\alpha / \alpha$ interfaces
- interphase interfaces: $\alpha/ \beta$ interfaces

Definitions:
- surface tension: at the liquid- air interfaces there is no strain; $[N/m]=[J/m^2]$;  attributable to the cohesive forces btw liquid molecules. 
- surface energy: same as tension, but for solids (actually is more general), units are the same $$\huge dW_{s(T,P)}= \gamma dA$$
$$\huge \gamma \text{ or } \sigma= lim_{\delta A \rightarrow 0}\frac{\delta W_{s(T,P)}}{\delta A}$$
measure of the excess energy at the surface of a material compared to its bulk

- Surface stress: work needed to deform reversibly a surface in solids, depends on direction, elastic regime, $[N/m]$ $$\huge \sigma = lim_{\delta l\rightarrow 0 \frac{\delta p'}{\delta l}}$$
in principle it's a tensor

- Sharp and diffuse interfaces: change in atomic configuration at either very short or considerable distance

- approach to describe the change in phase region: Surface phase (surface atoms/molecules treated as a phase)/ Gibbs dividing surface (properties change at a single plane)

Gibbs surface is a mathematical construction used to describe phase boundaries, where the change in phase is not abrupt but it follows a gradient. The areas of yellow coloured "triangles" is equal because of the mass conservation (to check)

Surface energy depends on T, P and most important here, the orientation of the grain:

In solids, surface energy depends on lattice plane. Average values are given below. Surface stress depends on lattice plane and direction of deformation.

GRAIN BOUNDARIES
Regions that separates two grains. Plastic deformation --> moving dislocations
![[Pasted image 20250317101213.png]]
so we have an extra plane of atoms, so there are some strain btw the the interfaces created by the dislocation. Deforming plastically the metal, we rearrange the atoms in the structure. If the crystal is ideal, breaking bonds is energetically high, if the crystal has dislocations in the bulk, if we apply a foce, the dislocation can move until it reaches a grain boundary. The dislocation should cross the grain boundary, but it takes more energy.  Generally, the more grain boundaries has the metal, the stronger it is. 
We have two types of grain boundaries:
- low angle : less than 10-15°
- high angle: more than 10-15°
The angle is $\theta$ in the picture:
![[Pasted image 20250317101934.png]]
when we have a small/low angle boundary, we can think of it as a set of dislocations one on the top of the other.
The interfacial energy here is given by the number of pile-up dislocations. In a simple way, we define the Burger vector $\vec b$ in the picture: magnitude of the distortion of the lattice; its modulus gives the distance of each dislocation $D$: $$D=\frac{|\vec b|}{sin \theta} \approx \frac{b}{\theta}$$
for small $\theta$
so the interfacial energy is approximately proportional to the density of dislocations:
$$\gamma \approx \frac{1}{D} \propto \theta$$

For high angle boundaries we have transition regions that give disordered structures:

SPECIAL GRAIN BOUNDARIES:
- Site coincidence

- twin boundary see paragraph 3.3.2 of the book

Coherent and incoherent twinning plane:
![[Pasted image 20250317103706.png]]

Energy of boundaries: high for incoherent, low for coherent.
Phases can differ also for the composition. In this case, we have 3 possible types of change in phase:
- coherent: continuous lattice arrangement, perfectly aligned crystallographic planes-- > periodicity maintained$$\gamma_{coherent}= \gamma_{chem}$$
- semi-coherent: the mismatch is larger(partial coherence), $\gamma$ has an additional term due to misfit dislocations separated by $D= \frac{d_{\beta}}{\delta}$ where $\delta=\frac{d_{\beta}-d_{\alpha}}{d_{\alpha}}$ ($d$ it's the lattice parameter):$$\gamma_{semi}= \gamma_{chem}+ \gamma_{disl}$$
- incoherent: less effective at blocking dislocations wrt coherent and semi-coherent

**Effect of interfaces on equilibrium: Laplace-Young equation**
![[Pasted image 20250317104930.png]]
$$\Delta P= \gamma \left( \frac{\partial A}{\partial V} \right) _T$$
when $\beta$ is very small and spherical: $$\Delta P= \frac{2 \gamma}{r}$$
where $r$ is the radius of the small particle of ohase $\beta$, try the chain rule to derive it.

We can apply the common tangent do determine $\Delta G$: 
![[Pasted image 20250317105258.png]]
where the left curve is for a certain phase $\alpha$ and the right one for a phase $\beta$. We can see that when $\beta$ is very small(when $r$ is small), $\Delta P$ generates a non negligible variation of the free energy! This explains e.g. why nanoparticles have lower melting point.
