More about ideal solutions

$$\Delta S_{mix}=-R(X_Aln(X_A)+X_Bln(X_B)) $$
if $\Delta H_{mix}=0$ , $\Delta G_{mix}= RT(X_Aln(X_A)+X_Bln(X_B))$

Mixing is always thermodianmically favorable.
or more precisely:

REGULAR SOLUTIONS
There are real systems that are close to the ideal model, but regular solutions are slightly more complex--> $\Delta H_{mix}\not=0$ and the entropy is the same as in ideal solution (configurational). The mixing enthalpy is proportional to the molar fractions.
![[Pasted image 20250311112909.png]]
we have 3 types of bonds: 
- A-A each with energy $\varepsilon_{AA}$
- A-B each with energy $\varepsilon_{AB}$
- B-B each with energy $\varepsilon_{BB}$
Assumptions: 
- bonding energies do not change with composition
- P and V remain constant when mixing (hence $\Delta U= \Delta H$)
which are not totally true in reality, but very close to.
so for these assumptions, $\Delta H= \Delta E + \cancel {\Delta(PV)}$ becomes just $\Delta H= \Delta E$.

  how to derive $P_{AA}$ and $P_{BB}$? 
  $$P_{AA} = \frac{1}{2} (zN_A-P{AB})$$
  $$P_{BB} = \frac{1}{2} (zN_B-P{AB})$$
  $$U = \frac{1}{2} z N_A\varepsilon_{AA}+ \frac{1}{2} z N_B \varepsilon_{BB}+ P_{AB}(\varepsilon_{AB}- \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{AA} -\frac 12 \varepsilon_{BB} )$$
  
  U is the internal energy after mix, which contains the first two terms of internal energy before mixing, so the $\Delta U_{mix}$ is just $P_{AB}(\varepsilon_{AB}- \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{AA}- \frac 12 \varepsilon_{BB})= P_{AB} \varepsilon = \Delta H_{mix}$  
Now we define $P_{AB}= N_a X_AzX_B$
where $N_aX_A$ is the number of lattice sites occupied by A atoms, and $zX_B$ is the probability that around a given lattice site there is a B atom.
$\Rightarrow \Delta H_{mix} = X_AX_BzN_a\varepsilon = \Omega X_AX_B$ 
where $\Omega$ ca be positive or negative:
if negative:
-  also the $\Delta H_{mix}$ is always negative, and $-T\Delta S_{mix}$ as well at high T
- at low T, always negative, but smaller in amplitude both for $\Delta H_{mix}$ and d $-T\Delta S_{mix}$
![[Pasted image 20250311114658.png]]

if positive: 
- $\Delta H_{mix}$ is positive for high T, the   $-T\Delta S_{mix}$ remains unchanged; the $\Delta G_{mix}$ is negative 
- At low T,    $-T\Delta S_{mix}$ is smaller in amplitude, so the $\Delta G_{mix}$ has a max positive in the middle of the composition: 
- ![[Pasted image 20250311115108.png]]
- so in the latter case, the mixing process is not thermodynamically favourable when the composition is 50%-50%.
$\Rightarrow$ MISCIBILITY GAPS
![[Pasted image 20250311115248.png]]
At low T, a miscibility gap is present, i.e. two solid solutions with the same
structure but different compositions appear (two tangent points from the
common tangent construction, see next slides).
Solubility may become complete above a critical temperature (one tangent point).
Quenching from high temperature may force (non-equilibrium) solubility.
That's why, when two components with the same crystal structure the outcome phase might be not the same of the initial, like two solid solutions with different compositions.
From the graph we see black straight lines which are tangent to the curves, which are the fraction of components where phases are in equilibrium.
We could also have a 3rd case: (see picture in the notes)

- 1 solid solution at $X_0$
- 2 pure elements separated
- 2 solid solutions $X_1$, $X_2$
this 3rd options is the most favourable.

CHEMICAL POTENTIALS IN BINARY SYSTEMS
Chemical potential in open systems: $$dG'= \mu_Adn_A$$ with $P,T,n_B$ constant, so in other words, $$\huge \mu_A = (\frac{\partial G'}{\partial n_A})_{T,P,n_B}$$
![[Pasted image 20250311122528.png]]
where G' is the Gibbs free energy of the system, not the molar Gibbs energy.
![[Pasted image 20250311122606.png]]![[Pasted image 20250311122618.png]]
where in the latter equation we consider variable compositions. In real solutions we consider the activity $a_{A,B}$ to define the chemical potential:
![[Pasted image 20250311122746.png]]

**Heterogeneous binary systems**
we thus have to consider 2 free energy curves ($G_{\alpha}$ and $G_{\beta}$)for two stable structures $\alpha$ ad $\beta$ for components A ad B respectively.
![[Pasted image 20250311122955.png]]
Left graph: $\alpha$ structure free energy. we see that the pure element B can be in the $\alpha$ crystal structure, but of course is not stable, in fact the point b is lower than point c.
Right graph: also curve for the $\beta$ structure, where the point f is the free energy of pure element A in the $\beta$ structure.
For different compositions, which phases are the most stable? What happens in between of pure elements compositions?
Mathematically, the minimum of the free energy in a heterogeneous equilibrium is equivalent to having each component with the same chemical potential in each phase, i.e.
$$\mu_A^{\alpha}= \mu_A^{\beta}$$
$$\mu_B^{\alpha}= \mu_B^{\beta}$$

There is also an equivalent geometrical construction (common tangent method).
In binary heterogeneous systems, you can find the equilibrium in the system by:
- minimizing the free energy
- equating the chemical potentials
- using the common tangent geometrical
we will discuss the last method.

THE COMMON TANGENT CONSTRUCTION

![[Pasted image 20250311123813.png]]
suppose that we have a composition $X_0$. We thus have two different possible values of free energies: $G_0^{\alpha}$ is the most stable. However, what if instead of having one only phase, we have two phases? That's why we consider points $G_1^{\alpha}$ and $G_1^{\beta}$. The total free energy will be the weighted sum of these two values. Notice that $G_1$ is even lower than the previous energies $G_0^{\alpha}$ and $G_0^{\beta}$ !!! 
Right graph tells how we can obtain the most stable structure, using the common tangent method at the minimum of both curves. More in general, whenever the composition is in between $\alpha_e$ and $\beta_e$, the possible free energies lie on the straight line ( the common tangent).
