\section{02-04-25: | Nucleation / Solidification}

In pure elements the Solidification tends to be homogeneous along a surface. If it happens that there's a protrusion there are two possible cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Typical case: the protrusion is reassorbed and the surface flattens
    \item Undercooling: the protrusion is favored and it grows perpendicular to the surface, generating 3D cross structures (Dendrites)
\end{itemize}
When we have binary alloys or so on, you use the `regola della leva'.
