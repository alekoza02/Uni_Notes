\begin{equation}
    uh = \nu \lambda
\end{equation}
Where $u$ is the additional width, $h$ the additional height and $\nu$ and $\lambda$ are bounded to the dinamic of the system. This also depends on how fast we can resupply the depletion zone generated by the nucleation of a new phase.

\paragraph{Transformed fraction f(t,T):} Referes to the amount of material that has successfully transformed from the inital phase to the new phase at anu given point in time during the process. It ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 is no transformation and 1 is 100\% conversion. Look for \textit{`Theory of transformed fraction f(t,T)'}.
