-  $n= N_C exp \left(\frac{E_F-E_C}{k_B T}\right)$  
- $p= N_V exp\left(\frac{E_V-E_F}{k_B T}\right)$
- $n*p = n_i ^2$
at EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS

DRIFT and DIFFUSION:
Drift: current as consequence as an application of $\Delta V$ on the material.
Intrinsic SC: $n=p=n_i$ 
(see picture 1)
![[06_1.jpg||200]]
$\mathcal E = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}>0$ 
Drude model:
- $v_{drift} \propto \mathcal E$ linearly
- for electrons $v_{drift,n}= - \mu_n \mathcal E$ where $\mu$ is the mobility (of electrons here)
- for holes $v_{drift,p}= \mu_p \mathcal E$
(see picture 2)
![[06_2.jpg|400]]
The mobility is expressed in $[\mu]= \frac{[v]}{[\mathcal E]}= \frac{cm*s^{-1}}{V*cm^{-1}}= cm^2 V^{-1}s^{-1}$
If the drift velocity is known, then the drift current density is:
$j_{drift,n} =(-e)nv_{drift,n}= (-e)n(-\mu_n)\mathcal E = +\sigma_n \mathcal E$   
$j_{drift,p} =(+e)pv_{drift,p} = +ep\mu_p \mathcal E = +\sigma_p \mathcal E$

so the total drift current density is $j_{drift}=j_{drift,n}+j_{drift,p}$ .

$E = (-e)V$
(see picture 3)
![[06_3.jpg|250]]
so in a semiconductor:
(see picture 4)
![[06_4.jpg|400]]
Overall the concentration of carriers in constant, but they move (they drift). The Fermi level follows the slope of $E_C,E_V$

Diffusion:
In absence of an applied electrical field, we expect no current, but if we suppose to have a SC with a gradient of concentration of carriers: (see picture 5) we have diffusion.
![[06_5.jpg|270]]
$j_{diff,p} =  -D_p(+ e) \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}$  when considering holes. We see a positive diffusion when the gradient is negative.
Summarising:
$j_{diff,p} =  - e D_p \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}$
$j_{diff,n} =   e D_n \frac{\partial n}{\partial x}$  it's positive because for electrons, the charge is negative
where the total diffusion current density is: $j_{diff}= j_{diff,p} + j_{diff,n}$ 

The measure unit of the diffusion coefficient is $[D]= cm^2 C^{-1} A= cm^2 C^{-1} Cs^{-1} =cm^2s^{-1}$

When the distance between $E_C$ and $E_F$ is constant, the SC has no concentration of carriers gradient, so no diffusion (see picture 4).
![[06_6.jpg|350]]
In picture 6 we see that there is diffusion. Thinking about electrons, we have more electrons in the left of the graph, so the gradient is negative. If $\frac{\partial n}{\partial x}$ the diffusion current for electrons in negative.
The gradient of concentration of holes is at the same time positive, so the diffusion current is positive.

**Link between $\mu$ and $D$: Einstein formula**
$D = \frac{k_B T \mu}{e}$ 

**Application: p-n junctions**
in the p part, we have many free holes and the same number of fixed electrons, the latter corresponding to ionised acceptors. 
in the n part we have many free electrons and the same number of fixed holes, the latter corresponding to ionised donors.

Majority carriers:
Holes in p side are pushed back by the built-in electrical field. Same for electrons in the n side

Minority carriers:
electrons in p side are attracted inside the depletion region: are drifted through the depletion region. Same for electrons in the n side.

We also have diffusion of majority carriers: free electron from the n side goes toward p side and viceversa for holes from the p side.

(see picture 7)
![[06_7.jpg|350]]
Alignment for energy levels in a p-n junction: one single Fermi level
(see picture 8)
![[06_8.jpg|350]]
if a system is in EQUILIBRIUM (no bias)
energy levels have a gradient inside the middle region, so the potential. --> we have an electrical field!(inside that region):
$\mathcal E = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}$  and $E = -eV$ 
-->$V= -\frac{1}{e}E$  so $\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}= -\frac{1}{e}\frac{\partial E}{\partial x}$   and    $\mathcal E = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}= +\frac{1}{e}\frac{\partial E}{\partial x}$ 

In the depletion region we thus have a drift current.

Outside the depletion region, we see that we have a constant concentration of carriers--> non diffusion. Inside the depletion region yes, so here we have diffusion. Focusing on electrons, we see that the concentration of electrons is increasing inside the depletion region, so the diffusion current density is positive.
Same for holes, gradient of $p$ is negative, so we have diffusion where the diffusion current density is positive.
The sum of drift and diffusion currents is $0$ at equilibrium because they are in opposite direction.

Built-in potential:
(see picure 9)
![[06_9.jpg|500]]
$$V_{bi}= \frac{k_BT}{e}ln\left(\frac{N_DN_A}{n^2} \right)$$



Now, let's draw the concentration of free carriers and their plot:
(see picture 10)
![[06_10.jpg|500]]
where we didn't draw the fixed charges.(ionised donors and ionised acceptors).

Now let's plot the **total** charge concentration:
Outside the depletion region, the total charge is $0$. The concentration of free carriers is negligible, as we can see in picture 10, so:
(see picture 11 version 1) sharp junction approximation
![[06_11_a.jpg|250]]
In reality, the variation is smoother (picture 11 version 2)
![[06_11_b.jpg|250]]
Plot of the electrical field:  we see that where we see (in sharp junction approximation) negative and constant charge density, we see constant and negative slope of the electrical field and viceversa where the charge density is constant and positive, according to the first Maxwell equations: $$\frac{\partial \mathcal E}{\partial x}=\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r}$$
(see picture 12)
![[06_12.jpg|250]]

Plot of the potential:
according to $$\mathcal E = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}$$
Because $E=-eV$, we see the same trend in the energy bands diagram inside the depletion region
(see picture 13).
![[06_13.jpg|250]]


Moreover, it is also to calculate the coordinates of the edges of the depletion region:
denoting with $-x_p$ the left edge of the depletion region, and wit $+x_n$ the right edge The center of the depletion region is at $x=0$. $$x_n = \sqrt{\frac{2 \varepsilon_o \varepsilon_r V_{bi}}{e N_D (1+ \frac{N_D}{N_A})}}$$
 $$x_p = \sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_o \varepsilon_rV_{bi}}{ eN_A (1+ \frac{N_A}{N_D})}}$$


Notice that when the SC is not in equilibrium conditions, the Fermi level doesn't exist (irradiation with light or application of $\Delta V$). We thus have two quasi-Fermi levels $E_{F,n}$ and $E_{F,p}$: the former is higher than the Fermi level when the SC was in equilibrium, the latter is lower.
