ELECTRON DIPOLES
system where electrons are in fixed positions (in the lattice). When an electric field is applied, the charges are redistributed, creating a macroscopic dipole moment.

For bound electrons: (see picture 1)
![[09_1_1.jpg]]

Today we focus on the term $\varepsilon_r$ inside the equation for $n$, the refractive index. $\varepsilon_r$ is related to the polarizability.
The dipole, in this system, is given by a nucleus + a bound electron --> oscillating and emitting photons, in a way described by the discrete set of energies / bands

(see picture 2)
![[09_2_1.jpg]]
The jump btw two energy bands corresponds to the change in oscillation of the dipole. 
Now we consider the tight-binding model, where the electron is bound: 
electron wavefunction for an electron bound to the crystal $|\phi > = \frac{1}{A}\sum_{i=1}^Nc_i |\psi (x-x_i)>$ 
$\hat H_{cryst}|\phi > =E|\phi>$ true if $\mathcal E=0$

but now we consider an elm interaction,$$\hat H_{cryst}= \hat T+ \sum_i \hat V_{at}+ \hat V_{pert}(x)\Rightarrow\hat H_{elm}= \hat H_{cryst}+ \hat V_{elm}$$
where $\hat V_{elm}= -q \mathcal E_0 e^{-i \omega t}= -q\mathcal E(t)$ 
Assumption: the state corresponding to $E_1$ is left untouched: $|\phi_1>$ doesn't change.

Which is the new $|\Phi(x,t)>$ ? We consider a superposition of $|\phi>$ s. 
$$|\Phi(x,t)>= \frac{1}{B}\sum_{E_l}b_l(t)|\phi_l(x)>$$
so in our particular 2 energy levels case: $$|\Phi(x,t)>= \frac{1}{B}\left[b_1(t)|\phi_1(x)>+b_2(t)|\phi_2(x)> \right]$$
any level can be occupied by the electron, the interaction gives the probability of occupation.
$$\cancel{\hat H_{elm}|\Phi(x,t) > =E(t)|\Phi(x,t)>}$$
this is stationary!

We have to take the full Sch. eq.: $$i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\Phi(x,t) >= \hat H_{elm}|\Phi(x,t) >$$
We are not going to do the full calculations, but summurizing:

1) plug $|\Phi(x,t) >$ and $\hat H_{elm}$ in the Sch. eq.
2) find expression/relation for the set $\{b_l(t) \}$
3) assumption on $\hat V_{elm}$ strength  ($\hat V_{elm} << \hat V_{cryst}$)
4) simplification: just consider transitions to/from the ground state $E_G$ 

How to connect the refractive index to the electron wave function? using the displacement vector  $\vec D= \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r \mathcal E = \varepsilon_0 \mathcal E + \vec P$ 

Polarization: $\vec P = \varepsilon_0(\varepsilon_r-1) \mathcal E$   so     $$\frac{\vec P}{\mathcal E} = \varepsilon_0(\varepsilon_r-1) $$
$$\varepsilon_r= 1+ \frac{\vec P}{\varepsilon_0\mathcal E}$$
$\vec P = \underbrace{n_b}_{\text{density of bound } e^{-}} \cdot \vec p$          where        $\vec p=q \vec d$       is the microscopic dipole moment.

$$\varepsilon_r= 1+ \frac{\vec P}{\varepsilon_0\mathcal E}= 1+ \frac{n_b \vec p}{\varepsilon_0\mathcal E}$$

in 1D: $p = q x$ --->  $p(t)= < \Phi (x,t)|qx|\Phi (x,t)>$   transition dipole moment operator

$\varepsilon_r(\omega) = 1+ \large \sum_{l \not= G}F_l \frac{\hbar ^2 \omega^2_b}{(E_l - E_G)^2- \hbar^2 \omega^2}$   where $F_l$ is the strength of interaction (e.g. selection rule $\Delta S= 0$)   and for $\omega^2_b$ is given by the same formalism of plasma frequency.
 
"quantum mechanics does not forbid anything, it is just a matter of probabilty" 

The denominator of the above equation is called *resonance* term for evident reasons. If 
 $E_l = E_G = \hbar \omega$, the resonance term goes to 0, so overall, we have $\infty$ !!! In other words, that particular transition when we have resonance, it's the only one that counts (in terms of probability).

Let's rewrite the denominator, which now we call $\alpha$: $$\alpha = \frac{1}{(\Delta E+ \hbar\omega)(\Delta E- \hbar\omega)}$$
$$\alpha = \frac{1}{(-\Delta E+ \hbar\omega)(\Delta E+ \hbar\omega)}$$

where $-\Delta E= E_l - E_G$ and $\Delta E= E_G - E_l$
(see picture 3)
![[09_3_1.jpg]]

overall, the refractive index becomes: $$n =  \left( 1+ \sum_{l \not= G} F_l \frac{\hbar ^2 \omega^2_b}{(E_l - E_G)^2- \hbar^2 \omega^2}+ \frac{i \omega_p^2}{\omega^2}\left[ \frac{\omega \tau}{1+ i\omega \tau}\right]  \right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
If the refractive index goes to $\infty$, the speed of the wave inside the material goes to 0, so no propagation but full absorption.


==LIGHT SCATTERING==
- ELASTIC
- INELASTIC

Elastic scattering:
(see picture 4)
![[09_4_1.jpg]]
with a delayed emission, depending on $|\Phi_l>$ ($10^{-12}-10^{-7}s$) 

Inelastic scattering: $h\nu \not=h \nu'$
Let's consider an insulator, like diamond ($E_g = 5.5 eV$, that is huge, so $n_C = 0$ and $n_b$ is pretty high)
In the refractive index, the third term is set to 0: $$n =  \left( 1+ \sum_{l \not= G} F_l \frac{\hbar ^2 \omega^2_b}{(E_l - E_G)^2- \hbar^2 \omega^2}+ \cancel{\frac{i \omega_p^2}{\omega^2}\left[ \frac{\omega \tau}{1+ i\omega \tau}\right]}  \right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
$\Rightarrow$ Rayleigh scattering  
(see picture 5)
![[09_5_1.jpg]]
so the transition, in principle, is forbidden, so it's not probable, in terms of Heisenberg principle, $\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$  where  $\Delta E=(E_l - E_G)$ , and $t= ?$  . The "forbidden level" is called VIRTUAL STATE.

OLIVERO LECTURE

(recap of p-n junctions, see picture 1)
![[09_1_2.jpg]]

CONTINUITY EQUATIONS FOR ELECTRONS: $$\frac{\partial\rho_n}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial j_n}{\partial x}= -(-e)U_n$$
where $U_n= R_n-G_n$ 
Notice that $U_p = U_n$ always, because they are net recombination rates, regardless we are in equilibrium or not. In equilibrium, they are both 0, in non equilibrium they are $\not= 0$ 
so $U_p = U_n= U$ and $$\frac{\partial j_p}{\partial x}+ \frac{\partial j_n}{\partial x}=-eU+eU= \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[j_p + j_n]=0$$
NON TRIVIAL APPROXIMATION: the current in the depletion region is constant.  The width of the depletion region is much smaller than the diffusion length. In a good material (low concentration of defects), $L \approx 10^2 \mu m$ while depeletion region width is $<1 \mu m$ . What happens to the current in the depletion region is unknown, but it doesn't affect so much the whole system. 

We are going to relax this assumption in the future.

(see picture 2)
![[09_2_2.jpg]]
so the current density in $+x_n$ is the same in $-x_p$ where both currents (holes and electrons) are known $$j_{tot}^{diff}= \large\underbrace{[+e \frac{D_p}{L_p}p_{n_o}+e\frac{D_n}{L_n}n_{p_o}]}_{j_0}[e^{\frac{eV}{k_BT}}-1] $$
the total current density is constant along the whole device! so if the total remain constant, and we know the minority carriers current, the majority carriers current has the opposite trend!
(see picture 3)
![[09_3_2.jpg|300]]

so the current is the current density multiplied by the cross section $S$:
$$S*j(V)= S*j_0[e^{\frac{eV}{k_BT}}-1]$$
$$\huge i(V)= i_0[e^{\frac{eV}{k_BT}}-1]$$
(see picture 4)
![[09_4_2.jpg|300]]
where $-i_0$ is the reverse bias saturation current. 

Suppose that we have a pn junction of Silicon. $N_D= 10^{13} cm^{-3}$ (small doping) and $N_A= 10^{18}cm^{-3}$ so the junction is asymmetric. The section is $S= 1 cm^2$. $D_p = 10cm^2 s^{-1}$ , $D_n= 35 cm^2s^{-1}$ and $\tau_n \approx \tau_p \approx 1 \mu s$  
What is the value of $i_0$?


- $$L_p= \sqrt{D_p \tau_p}= \sqrt{10 cm^2 s^{-1}*10^{-6}s} \approx 3*10^{-4}cm= 30 \mu m$$
- same for $L_n \approx 60 \mu m$
- $\large p_{n_0}= \frac{n_i^2}{N_D}= \frac{10^{20}cm^{-6}}{10^{13}cm^{-3}}= 10^7 cm^{-3}$
- $\large n_{p_0}=\frac{n_i^2}{p_{p_0}}=10^2 cm^{-3}$ negligible
$\Rightarrow$

$$i_0 = 1 cm^2 \left[  1.6*10^{-19}C \frac{10cm^2 s^{-1}}{3*10^{-3}cm}10^7cm^{-3} \right]\approx 5*10^{-9}A\approx 1 \ nA$$
$$j_{tot}^{diff}= \large\underbrace{[+e \frac{D_p}{L_p}\frac{1}{N_D}+e\frac{D_n}{L_n}\frac{1}{N_A}]}*n_i^2*[e^{\frac{eV}{k_BT}}-1] $$

so $\huge i_0 \propto n_i^2= N_C N_V exp [-\frac{E_g}{k_BT}]$

so for smaller energy gaps, the saturation current is higher. Germanium has a smaller energy gap (0.67 eV), used for SEM, so in order to reduce the $i_0$ ("dark current") they have to cool down the system. 

SiC --> $4 eV$!! very large gap, very small dark current.


Let's summarize the assumptions:
- full ionization of dopants
- sharp depletion region
- weak injection
- transparency of the depletion region

Now we discard the last point:
we discuss more in detail the recombination-generation theory.
The net recombination rate is $$U = \frac{\Delta p}{\tau}$$
n-doped SC, equilibrium:
(see picture 5)
![[09_5_2.jpg|250]]
every single second, millions of electrons are excited in the CB and millions of holes are filled, so $U=0$.

In indirect band gap SC, this does not occur like this. (see picture 6) Here, the probability of direct transition from $E_C$ to $E_V$ is very low. 
![[09_6_2.jpg|300]]
Real SC: (picture 7)--> defects in the crystal introduce intra-gap energy levels. Electrons in the CB and VB are delocalized : BLOCH QUANTUM STATES. Electron in the defect states are, on the other hand, LOCALIZED--> no well defined $k$ value. 
![[09_7_2.jpg|300]]

The transitions involving the intragap states do not break the general rule of moment conservation, so they are much more probable! --> we have a double step, e.g. from CB to an intragap level, the to the VB. ---> **Shockley-Read-Hall theory**. 

Let's start with a drastic simplification: in a crystal we have 300 different types of defects. Too complicated: let's consider just one type of defects: just one level $E_T$, a "trap level", deep in the gap. (see picture 8 and 9). 
![[09_8_2.jpg|400]]
![[09_9_2.jpg|200]]
One trap level can be neutral: $T^0$  , or charged, $T^{+1, -3, ...}$
but for simplicity, here we have just $T^{0/+}$ 
So if it's neutral, the defect has an electron trapped, if it's positive, it lost an electron. 

From picture 8:
a) recombination rate of electrons $R_n$  --->   $T^+ \rightarrow T^0$ 
b) generation rate of electrons $G_n$ --->   $T^0 \rightarrow T^+$
c) one electron in the VB is trapped in $E_T$---> injection of a hole in the VB 
d) one electron from $E_T$ goes to the VB, ---> stealing of a hole from the VB

- Let's start with $R_n$: intuitively, it's proportional to the concentration of electrons in the CB and to the concentration of *empty* traps in $E_T$:
$$R_n\propto n* N_T^+$$
Let's replace the proportionality with a parameter, which is the probability of trapping an electron per unit of concentration: $$R_n = r_n*n* N_T^+$$

- for $G_n$, we have that we have that the number of emty states in the CB in nearly $\infty$, so: $$G_n=g_n*N_T^0$$
because for sure the electron will meet an empty state in the CB (probability = 1)

- $R_p$ is critically depending on the density: $$R_p = r_p*p*N_T^0$$
- $$G_p= g_pN_T^+$$

These probabilities are described by the Fermi-Dirac distribution: $$\huge f_{FD}(E)= \frac{1}{e^{\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}}+1}$$

so $N_T^0= N_T f_{FD}(E)$   $N_T^+= N_T [1-f_{FD}(E)]$
