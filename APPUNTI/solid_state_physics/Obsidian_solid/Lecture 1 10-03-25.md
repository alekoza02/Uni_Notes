ripasso:
1) Describe a linearly polarised elm wave
	Oscillating elm magnetic field $\vec E \perp \vec B \perp \hat k$ propagating at the speed of light $c$, if we are in vacuum, $c= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon _0}}$   
Linearly polarised means that $\vec E$ oscillates on a fixed plane (e.i. in the xz plane) so the $\vec B$ is in the x-y plane. 
$$\vec E = \vec E_0 cos (kx-\omega t)= \vec E_0 e^{ikx-wt}$$
	in one direction, where $\vec E_0 = \mathcal{E} \hat z$
(we forget about y); $k$ is the wave vector and $\lambda$ is the wavelength: $k= \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}$ and $\omega = \frac{2 \pi}{T}$ it's the pulse; $c= \frac {\lambda}{T}=\lambda \nu = \frac{\omega}{k}\approx 3*10^8 m/s$ 

2) Band diagram of a crystal?
Bands with alternating permitted and forbidden states of energies. The valence band is referred as the last filled band. In a metal there is a not completely filled band, so electrons can jump easily to higher energies. In semiconductors and insulators, the last band (the conduction band) is empty. Electrons at the top of the VB require a much higher energy gap in order to go to CB. This jump can occur for thermal energies, in such cases, we have: $$E_T = k_BT \approx 26 meV$$
at RT ($=300 K$)
Energy gaps are more or less about 1-3 eV for semiconductors (Si 1.12 eV) and more than 3 eV for insulators (diamond 5.5 eV). In order to distinguish these two kind of solids, we know that the probability for an electron to jump is $\propto e^{\frac{k_B T}{E_g}}$  . So what is defining a SC from an insulator is the temperature.

3) What is a photon? 
It's an elementary particle affected by the wave-particle duality. The energy of a photon is defined by $E= h \nu$. A photon has no mass, spin=1. Conversion factor form E in eV and $\lambda$ in nm is $$E=\frac{1240 eV*nm}{\lambda}$$
It's also useful to define the momentum $$\vec p= \hbar \vec k $$
4) What is a phonon?
It's an elementary quantum of lattice vibration. In a 1D lattice: 

o --- o --- o --- o
	Where between an atom and the next one we can describe bonds with springs that vibrate around the equilibrium position. Different materials have different strentghs of these springs, so different specific frequencies. This is why we can investigate solids with Raman spectroscopies $$E_{\Omega}= \hbar \Omega$$
	where $\Omega$ is the vibration pulse and $E_{\Omega}$ is quantized: $E_{\Omega, n}= (1/2 +n) \hbar \Omega$
	Which means that if $n=1$ we have one phonon, if $n=2$ we have 2 phonons and so on. We can define a density of phonons: $$\rho_{\Omega}\propto \frac{1}{exp[\frac{\hbar \Omega}{kT}]-1}$$
5) What is the Snell's law?
It describes a light ray crossing an interface between two different materials, (indicizzati) with 1 and 2. These two materials have two different refracting indeces: $$n=\frac{c}{v}$$
where $v$ is the speed of light inside the material. The Snell law states that $$n_1 sin \theta_1 = n_2 sin \theta_2$$

6) Write the superposition of two states
$$|\psi \rangle = a |\psi_a \rangle+b|\psi_b \rangle$$
where $$|a|^2+|b|^2=1$$
and $$|\psi \rangle= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_a \rangle+ e^{i \varphi}|\psi_b \rangle$$
In general: 
$$\sum_{i=1}^N|c_i|^2=1$$
$$|\psi \rangle= \sum_{i=1}^N|c_i|^2|\psi_i\rangle$$
7) and 8) how photon absorption can occur? What is a p-type SC?
A photon can give the energy required to promote an electron from the VB to the CB if the $E_{gap}$ is $\leq h \nu$ (c'mon you know what a p-type SC is)

9)Ohm's law macroscopic and microscopic?
$$V=RI$$
Microscopically, we use the Drude's model: $$\vec j= \sigma \vec E$$
where $\sigma$ is the conductivity of the material
