ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES (with Olivero)
Exam: questions start with the final formula of the topic, explain it and ==measure units==, the derivation is optional. Measure units are essential in order to pass the exam.
We can give the exam in two different sessions, one part with Forneris, one with Olivero.

**Quick recap of p-n junctions**
(explanation of a band structure, Bloch theorem, which delocalise electrons in crystals.)
In semiconductors, at $T\rightarrow 0 K$, electrons completely fill the VB, while the CB is empty, so no conductivity. The top of the valence band is called $E_V$. The lowest energy level of the CB is called $E_C$. At room temperature, $e^-$ can occupy CB, so there are holes in the VB. When an external $\mathcal E$ is applied, electrons are able to change their quantum states, in other words they can change the energy level, so they give conduction. The electrons are thus called charge carriers. At the same time, holes $h^+$ move in the opposite direction. This is the case of intrinsic semiconductors, as Si with no defects introduced. 
The concentration of free electrons in the CB are referred as $n$, so number of $e^-$ per unit of volume.
The concentration of free holes in the VB are referred as $p$, so number of $h^+$ per unit of volume $[cm^{-3}]$.
The dependance of $p,n$ on T is exponential.  
On the other hand, in a metal, a single band is partially occupied, so there is no band-to-band transition of charge carriers, and there is not an energy gap between unoccupied and occupied states, because in metals electrons and unoccupied states are in the same band.

In addition to this, we have to consider semiconductors (as Si) in which $E_V$ corresponds to a momentum (or wavenumber $k$) different from the one of $E_C$ ---> indirect band gap.
In the two $k$ are the same, we have a direct band gap. The interaction with light is different for these two situations.

In an intrinsic SC (semiconductors), the conductivity depends on $n$ and $p$.  How to determine them? With a statistical distribution by which energy levels are occupied by electrons. This model is based on the probability of a state of being occupied: FERMI DIRAC statistical distribution.
$f_{F}$ is the Fermi-Dirac function, that describes the probability of states being occupied. At $0 K$ the function is a simple step, easily defining the Fermi energy. Increasing T, the step smooths out, meaning that there are electrons above the Fermi energy ($E_F$) and holes below the $E_F$ .

from here, we see that we have 100% prob of states occupied even in the spot x: it does not make sense, but if you see, you can notice that there there are no existing states.
We also see that at $T>0 K$ we see occupied states in VB and unoccupied states in CB.
$$f_F(E)= \frac{1}{e^{\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}}+1}$$
The density of states (DOS) is $$g(E)\Rightarrow DOS$$
the product of these two functions gives how many quantum states are available per unit of volume.
see picture 3:

- $n= \int_{E_C}^ {\infty} g(E)f_F(E) dE = N_C exp \left(\frac{E_F-E_C}{k_B T}\right)$  
- $p= \int_{- \infty}^{E_V} g(E)f_F(E) dE = N_V exp\left(\frac{E_V-E_F}{k_B T}\right)$
this holds also for extrinsic (doped) SCs. In extrinsic SCs, there are introduced electrons that are distant of many lattice constants from their nuclei. The introduction of a loosely bound electron is given by a P atom (which acts as donor) for instance, in a Si crystal, where the valence is different. 
So, in intrinsic SCs, $n=p$. In extrinsic SCs, we have an additional free electron $e^-$, its counter ion is positive, but this positive charge is fixed!

LAW MASS ACTION
- $n*p=n_i^2$ 
where $n_i$ is the concentration of $n$ or $p$ in intrinsic SCs. This also holds for extrinsic SCs! But in extrinsic SCs, while $n$ increases, $p$ decreases: this is the case of an n-type SC.
Conversely, introducing a B atom in a Si crystal, we have a missing electron in the lattice, so it acts as acceptor of an electron from the VB, so we have a hole $h^+$ in the VB, but without an additional $e^-$ in the CB!

The weakly bound electron of the P atom in Si crystal has thus a lower energy wrt other energy states in the CB, but it means that we have an energy level inside the forbidden Energy Gap. At RT, the electron goes in the CB, leaving a LOCALIZED HOLE in the band gap.

The hole formed by B atom in the Si crystal generates an empty energy level slightly above the top of the VB, so there is at RT a probability that an electron from the VB can fill this level, giving a LOCALIZED ELECTRON in the band gap.

 At RT, $T_{amb}= 300 K$; $1C * 1V = 1J$ so if we have $1.6*10^{-19}C$, $1.6*10^{-19} J =1 eV$ 
  $$k_B T_{amb} =26 meV$$  Full ionisation hypothesis:
  suppose that we dope a SC with 1 ppm of P atoms. The density of Si is $\rho_{at} \approx 10^{22}cm^{-3}$ .
  We thus have $N_D= 10^{-6}10^{22}cm^{-3}= 10^{14} cm^{-3}$ so electrons in the CB  are $n \approx 10^{14} cm^{-3} \approx N_D$ neglecting $n_i$ . 
   where all the donors (all the P atoms) are ionised at RT: $N_D\approx N_D^+$ which means that all the electrons of P goes to CB.

$N_C$ and $N_V$ are the effective concentrations of the SC, meaning states that are potentially occupied.

SCs are extremely sensitive to the impurity concentrations, that's why it is so important to synthesise SC with impurities $<1 ppb$, otherwise it would not be possible to control the concentration of impurities in order to have different properties.

let's denote finally that
-  $n= N_C exp \left(\frac{E_F-E_C}{k_B T}\right)$  
- $p= N_V exp\left(\frac{E_V-E_F}{k_B T}\right)$
- $n*p = n_i ^2$
if $N_C \approx 10^{+19}$ in intrinsic SC, we have $n= n_i = 10^{+10} cm^{-3}$
if we dope the SC, $n= 10^{14} cm^{-3}$ 

If $E_F$ is so close to CB that we can say that they coincide, it means that the exponential goes to 1, so $n \approx N_C= 10^{19} cm^{-3}$ , meaning $\approx 1ppt$ (part per thousands) which is very high! It means that we doped a lot the SC. If we further increase the doping, the Fermi level enters in the CB!!! We thus have NO LONGER a SEMICONDUCTOR! We are thus in the case of *degenerate doping*. 
To summarise: when $n> 10^{19}$ we have a degenerate SC. At the same time, $p$ is decreased for the law of action mass (also we can see that in the formula of $p$ we have a big value of $E_V-E_F$) . 


Let's just say now that instead of Si, we want to work with GaN because it has a larger band gap. We want a certain level of purity. Vanadium can introduce a level close to CB--> donors, so at RT a part of the donors are ionised because the distance btw the donor level $E_D$ and the CB is $0.4 eV$. This is not so good, because we have just $\approx 15 \%$ of ionised donors...
We thus have to find a donor that introduce a shallow enough level in the forbidden gap.

With Si, there are no acceptors/donors that acts better than P and B.
Also for p-type diamond, we can use B. Conversely, P is a bad donor for diamond because of the deep $E_D$. At the moment, for diamond we don't know how to make it a good n-type diamond.
