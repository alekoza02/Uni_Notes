recap:
- $\huge \mathcal E= \mathcal E_0 e^{ik_0nx-i \omega t}$ 
- if $\omega> \omega_0$ , propagation, otherwise reflection
- $n= (\varepsilon_r + \frac{i \sigma(\omega)}{\varepsilon_0 \omega})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ where $\varepsilon_r$ is the bound electrons polarizability
- if $\omega = E_j - E_G$, the photon is absorbed
- Considering a general medium with free and bound electrons, we can evaluate the transmittance $T$: the fraction of photons that are transmitted
$$T= \frac{I_T}{I_0}$$
(see picture 1)

where $\lambda \propto \frac{1}{\omega}$  and $\lambda_p \propto \frac{1}{n_c}$ is the plasma frequency. At some point, we will have a frequency of the photon $\omega = E_j - E_G= \large E_{gap}= \frac{nc}{\lambda_{gap}}$ 

The energy o f the emitted photon is not necessarily equal to the energy gap, so the picture above is not always so sharp.

Now suppose that we have diamond: no electrons in the CB, transparent to visible light because it has an energy gap of 5.5 eV. we send a photon in the orange: $h \nu = 2 eV= 620 nm$. We will never find a state with $E_g + h\nu$ quantum mechanically---> virtual state
We know from Heisenberg that $\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$  where the ground state is $E_G = 0 \pm \Delta E$ supposing that the ground state is at 0 eV.  If $\Delta E= 2 eV$:
-  $\Delta t?$ $$\Delta t= \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta E} \approx \frac{10^{-34}Js}{5*10^{-19}J}= 2*10^{-16}s$$
--> not measurable: the uncertainty of the time is so small, that we can consider null the time in which a photon is absorbed and re-emitted when the energy of the photon is smaller than the energy gap.
That's why we can use a time-independent Hamiltonian for an electron of energy $E_G + h \nu<E_g$ . The the electron comes back to the ground state emitting a photon with the same energy of the incident one. We thus have elastic scattering (Rayleigh). 

Inelastic scattering: when we are not at T= 0 K, we have lattice vibrations---> more vibrational energy levels $E_j+ N \hbar \Omega$ . This is the key for Raman scattering. We have an incident photon $h \nu$  at the order of eV, like a laser source. The electron has an energy $E_j$   and the next level is $\large E_j+ \underbrace{\hbar \Omega}_{\approx \mu eV}$
Then the electron absorbs the photon energy going up to an excited state $E_j + h \nu$. After this, the electron doesn't go necessarily to the ground state. It happens with a smaller probability that the electron goes in the vibrational energy level, so the emitted photon has an energy $$\huge h \nu'=(E_j+ h \nu)-(E_j+ \hbar \Omega)=\underbrace{h \nu}_{photon}- \underbrace{\hbar \Omega}_{phonon}$$
(see picture 2)---> Raman Stokes scattering

Anti-Stokes Raman scattering:
the electron is already in the vibrational energy level $E_j+ \hbar \Omega$  so it goes, after excitation of a photon, in the virtual state $E_j+ \hbar \Omega+ h \nu$ . If the electron goes back in the vibrational state, we have again Rayleigh scattering. The electron can also goes down to the ground state, having a final emitted energy of  $$\huge h \nu'=(E_j+ h \nu+ \hbar \Omega)-E_j= h \nu + \hbar \Omega$$
---> phonon annihilation (see picture 3)

Remind that the virtual state is one of the energy levels that are in principle forbidden. We have seen that electrons can have that energies, but the time in which they remain is very small.

(lab explanation of a Raman measurement: set-up, measure steps...)
Notice that at 0 K we cannot have AntiStokes transitions, while we can have Stokes. Increasing the temperature, the prob of having AntiStokes transitions increases exponentially, up to Stokes intensity. In general, the Stokes peak is more intense. 
The strength of the Raman spectroscopy is that the Stokes shift in the same for different $\lambda$ sources, because what we measure is a difference between Stokes peak and Rayleigh peak
