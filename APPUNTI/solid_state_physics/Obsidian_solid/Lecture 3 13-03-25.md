Crystalline Hamiltonian: $$\hat H_{cry}= \hat T+ \sum_i^N \hat V_{at}(x-x_i)+ \hat V_{pert}$$
Sch eq $$\hat H_{cry}|\phi\rangle= E_{cry}|\phi\rangle$$
$$=(E_0+ \Delta E) |\phi \rangle$$

where 
$$\Delta E = \int \langle\phi(x)|\hat V_{pert}|\phi(x)\rangle dx$$

Bloch function:
$$|\phi(x) \rangle = \frac{1}{A} \sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i |\psi(x-x_i) \rangle$$
Two cases: 
- $$|\phi_+(x) \rangle= \frac{1}{A} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |\psi(x-x_i)\rangle$$
- 
$$|\phi_-(x) \rangle= \frac{1}{A} \sum_{i=1}^{N}(-1)^i |\psi(x-x_i)\rangle$$

Taking a slice of these two last plots:
![[Pasted image 20250313093557.png|500]]
Try to make considerations about how to justify the shape of the plots for different orbitals (in the pdf).



see picture 1:
![[03_1.jpg|400]]
are these two wavefunctions periodical?
yes: $\phi_-$ has the same periodicity of the lattice
$\lambda =2d$
$k= \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}= \frac{\pi}{d}$
no: $\phi_+$ is mainly a flat line, so $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$ so $k=0$ 

RECIPROCAL LATTICE
$|\phi_+(x) \rangle \longleftrightarrow k=0$
$|\phi_-(x) \rangle \longleftrightarrow k= \pi/d$
these are the 2 limiting cases by which we can define the first Brillouin zone $k \in [0, \pi/d]$ 


so $\Delta E= \Delta E(k)$ just because $\{ |\phi \rangle\} \leftrightarrow k$ 
limit cases $\Delta E_{\pm}$ :
 $\Delta E_+ >$ or $< \Delta E_-$ ?
 Assumptions:
 0) $\hat V_{pert} < 0$
1) $|\phi_+ \rangle$ is definite positive, $|\phi_- \rangle$ has mixed sign, so $\Delta E_{+} \leq 0$
2) $\hat V_{pert}(x) \in \mathcal R, \forall x$, so $\langle \phi_-|\hat V_{pert | \phi_- \rangle = \langle \phi_-|| \phi_- \rangle V_{pert}(x)}$
3) $\langle \phi_+| \phi_+ \rangle > \langle \phi_-|\phi_- \rangle$   so $|\Delta E_+| > |\Delta E_-|$
since both are negative, $\Delta E_{\pm}<0 \Rightarrow \Delta E_+ < \Delta E_-$
see picture 2:
![[03_2.jpg]]
we see a range of permitted energies: an energy band. Why a band?

see picture 3:

where the electron can have all different value of momentum inside the FBZ.


DIRECT/BRAVAIS LATTICE
we are in the space coordinates, so any node has a certain position represented by a vector $\vec r = n_1 \vec r_1 + n2 \vec r_2 + n_3 \vec r_3$ where $\{\vec r_i \}$ are primitive vectors and $\{n_i \} \in \mathcal Z$
see picture 4
![[03_4.jpg]]
While the reciprocal lattice is defined by k vectors defined by $\{\vec b_i \}$ and $\{m_i \} \in \mathcal Z$. 

Primitive cell

Reciprocal primitive cell: Brillouin zone

Exercises:
1) square lattice (see notes how to define geometrically the FBZ)
![[03_ex.jpg]]
2) see pdf 03-wigner-seitz cell for 3D cubic lattice 
![[Pasted image 20250313103239.png|400]]
![[Pasted image 20250313103215.png|300]]
so the FBZ is:
![[Pasted image 20250313103310.png|300]]
where we have 6 planes that intersect, obtaining:
![[Pasted image 20250313103358.png|300]]
from which we can determine points of interest:
![[Pasted image 20250313103452.png|300]]


see in the pdf the face centred lattice fcc:
we need here a diatomic base to define the lattice. (ripassa elettronica modula A)
mind that that the reciprocal of fcc is a bcc and viceversa.

Points of interest in fcc reciprocal lattice:

However, in order to represent the FBZ, 1D is not always the best:

Dispersion relation (see the graph in the picture 5)

PHOTON ABSORPTION
Flat energy bands model: semiconductors
(see picture 6)
![[03_5&6.jpg|500]]
and when the energy bands are not flat? (so when $E = E(k)$)
Let's see the silicon band diagram:
![[Pasted image 20250313105052.png|100]]
where we see that that the max of VB is in the point $\Gamma$, while the min of the CB is in point $X$, so we have an indirect band gap.

Let's now see the GaAs band diagram:
![[Pasted image 20250313105440.png|100]]
where we see that the band gap is direct.
When we talk about photon absorption, we have to consider:
- energy conservation, so $h \nu = E_g$
- momentum conservation, so $p= \hbar k$ so the transition is vertical. That's fine for direct gaps, but for indirect gaps we would need a slanted transition, which violates this principle. We have to justify why the transition happen even for indirect gaps! (phonons...)
